Band member <a href=# title="John Frusciante Net Worth">John Frusciante</a> stated, "My girlfriend's father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn't be offended if we didn't like it, but we loved what he did. He's also given us great covers for all the singles. He's a true artist."</p><p>From September 2010 to January 2011, the Art Gallery of Ontario housed an exhibition of Schnabel's work that took up the entire fifth floor. In 2011, Museo Correr in Italy put up the exhibition "Julian Schnabel: Permanently Becoming and the Architecture of Seeing."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166552 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GettyImages-76497979.jpg alt="Julian Schnabel" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-166552 class=wp-caption-text>Chris Jackson / Getty Images</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Julian made his directorial debut with 1996's "Basquiat."

The home used to be a horse stable, but Schnabel converted it, adding five condos made to look like Northern Italian palazzos. The home is pink, and it includes an art gallery space, parking garage, and swimming pool. The building could be extremely valuable if it was ever offered for sale. Comparable prices would be impossible to peg.</p><p>In March 2020 Julian's ex-wife Jacqueline sold the townhouse in the West Village where they lived while they were married, for $18 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7w6KpnpukpL%2B0e8muo6KZnmLApLTNmpmepF2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./justin-simmons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Simmons- Wiki, Age, Husband, Ethnicity,Net Worth, Height, Career">&larr;
