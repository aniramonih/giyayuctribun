For the Monk series, in fact, he was nominated for four straight Emmys, winning three of them. Be it a big role or a small supporting stint; Tony essays it to perfection.</p><p>Maybe you know about Tony Shalhoub very well, but do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Tony Shalhoub’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Tony Shalhoub is of Lebanese descent and was born to Joe Shalhoub, who migrated from Lebanon and Helen Shalhoub, who was a second-generation Lebanese- American. He was the last but one sibling of ten brothers and sisters. Among his siblings are Michael Shalhoub and Susan Shalhoub Larkin. Shalhoub’s family was not rich per se, and his father owned a mobile meat truck. Tony and his family lived in Green Bay, Wisconsin.</p><p>Shalhoub’s interest in theater grew from an early age and rather coincidentally. It was his sister who requested him to be part of a high school production, The King and I, as an extra. Though Tony did not get to play a part, that moment he says was so profound that he wanted to pursue the performing arts.</p><p>He attended Green Bay East High School. Later he earned his bachelor’s degree in theater from the University of Southern Maine. Post his graduation, he enrolled in the distinguished Yale School of Drama and graduated with a master’s degree in performing arts in 1980. To hone his skills, Shalhoub spent some time at the American Repertory Theater.</p><p>But he wanted to make it big in the field of acting and moved to New York, where initially he had to wait tables. Finally, in 1985 he made his Broadway debut in the Rita Moreno/Sally Struthers production of The Odd Couple. In 1992 he was nominated for the Tony Award for his role in Conversations with My Father.</p><p>Though Shalhoub started getting television and movie offers and even acted in them, his love for theater ensured that he kept returning to Broadway. In December 2006, he starred in a play opposite Patricia Heaton for The Scene by Theresa Rebeck. Again in 2010, he went to Broadway to act as Saunders in a revival version of Lend Me a Tenor, in which his wife Brookes also participated.</p><p>As Shalhoub’s wife also came from a theater background, post-marriage, they starred together in plays, one of which was Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days in 2015. He was nominated for Tony Award for two consecutive years, 2013 and 2014, for his roles in Golden Boy and Act One, both of which were Lincoln Center Theater productions.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Shalhoub met his wife, Brooke Adams, in Broadway in 1989, both were theatre actors. It is a popular conjecture that it was during the stage play The Heidi Chronicles that the two got close and later tied the knot in 1992. Adams had an adopted daughter, Josie Lynn, who was all of three years when the couple got hitched. In 1994, the couple adopted Sophie, their second daughter, aged one. Shalhoub officially adopted Josie in 1997, when she was around eight years old.</p><p>Shalhoub is a family man and has often shown this side of his when he owned up that being a workaholic has affected his health and personal life, as he wished to spend more time with his family. Also, during the 2019 Emmy Awards function, he cheerfully declared that he was super excited to be a grandfather in real life as his eldest daughter was expecting a child in early 2020. Earlier in 2003, when he won the Emmy Award for his leading role in the television series Monk, he dedicated the award to his nephew, 34-year-old Gregg Gensler, who passed away the day before.</p><p>Tony Shalhoub’s parents were followers of the Maronite Church in Lebanon, an eastern arm of the Catholic Church, and Tony himself also follows the Catholic faith. Apart from two famous siblings, Tony has two other relatives who are quite well-known – Lynne Adams and Jonathon Brandmeier.</p><p>Besides theater and the performing arts, Tony takes an interest in football. He is a huge fan of the Green Bay Packers and is a season ticket holder. He confesses that as he spent most of his life in Green Bay, he is extremely loyal to this football club. Shalhoub was born in the US and hence spoke American English, but as he has Lebanese roots, he is fluent in Arabic as well.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 9 October 1953, Tony Shalhoub is 70 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.73 m tall, and his weight is 65 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>While still part of Broadway theater, Shalhoub got to play one of his famous characters Antonia Scarpacci in the NBC sitcom Wings. In the first two seasons, he was merely a guest character, but the idiosyncratic, self-deprecating, insecure Italian character of Antonio got enough audience appreciation to become a main character in the later seasons.</p><p>Though Tony did not win any awards for his role, it definitely established him as a television and film actor. It was posted this performance that he was considered for the films like Quick Change (1990), Barton Fink (1991), Big Night (1996), Men in Black (1997), Paulie (1998), The Siege (1998), and Galaxy Quest (1999).</p><p>Big Night earned him a win (1997, NSFC) and three nominations – New York Film Critics Circle Awards (Best Supporting Actor), Film Independent Spirit Awards (Best Male Lead), and Chlotrudis Awards (Best Actor). Other movies he acted in include: Spy Kids, Thirteen Ghosts, The Man Who Wasn’t There (2001), and &nbsp;1408 (2007).</p><p>But by far, the character that is still etched in every viewer’s mind is that of Adrian Monk, the deliriously funny and obsessive detective. More recently, the character of Abe Weissman from the television series, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, has caught audiences’ attention. In this series, Tony plays a mathematics professor at Columbia University-turned-theater critic. He is the father of the main character Midge Maisel, played by Rachel Brosnahan.</p><p>Tony also rendered his voice to many on-screen characters like the voice of Luigi, a 1959 Fiat 500 who runs a tire shop in the 2006 Disney/Pixar film Cars. He continued voicing over for the animation series in its 2011 and 2017 sequels, Cars 2 and Cars 3, respectively. Even the mutant rat from the 2014 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Splinter’s voice-over was by Tony Shalhoub.</p><p>Tony Shalhoub has always been supportive of the Arab-American community, given he himself belongs to the same lineage. He tied up with Network of Arab-American Professionals and Zoom-in-Focus Productions, to establish The Arab-American Filmmaker Award Competition, since 2005.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Shalhoub has won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, of which three were for his role as Adrian Monk, and one for his role as Abe Weissman. For his work on Broadway, he has won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance as Tewfiq Zakaria in The Band’s Visit. He has also bagged Screen Actors Guild Awards four times, twice for Monk and twice for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</p><p>He received a 2008 Grammy nomination in the category “Best Spoken Word Album for Children” for his narration of The Cricket in Times Square.</p><h2>Net Worth& Salary of Tony Shalhoub in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Tony-Shalhoub-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Tony Shalhoub’s net worth is $35 million. His income primarily comes from television series. He has played supporting roles in movies as well. In 2016, the actor and his wife sold their long time home in Windsor Square for $3.6 million. The couple lives in Los Angeles and has a cozy summer home on Martha’s Vineyard, an island in Massachusetts. The rentals and property prices on this island are 96% more than the average rentals in the region.</p><p>In his late sixties, the actor is still in his acting prime. He owes his success entirely to his rigorous theater training years. In fact, he admitted that he “still thinks of himself as a stage actor. When he does film and television, he tries to implement what he was taught to do in theater, to try to stretch into characters that are far from himself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZMGwuthmqqGZnJ28tq6Mp5ytZaekv7W0jGtna2hdZ31zfY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./francesca-farago-ex-on-the-beach-new-series-lesbian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Too Hot To Handle's Francesca Farago 'signs up for Ex On The Beach's new series that will see first ">&larr;
