The sports personality, however, does not look like she has had any cosmetic work done. There was a point when she looked like she had fillers. But either she dissolved it or they settled because she looks very natural now. Julie Ertz has never once responded to plastic surgery speculations.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Julie Ertz</strong> is easily one of the most skilled female <a href=#><strong>soccer players</strong></a> in America. She has made it to the National Women's Soccer League club and the United States women's national team. She first played in the national team in February 2013 during an internationally friendly game against Scotland. She has made more than 100 appearances for the team since then.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>sports personality</strong></a> helped the team win their titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup after which she was named to the FIFA Women's World Cup All-Star Team. In 2017, Julie Ertz was awarded U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year. She was nominated for the award again in 2018 and she won in 2019. After that, she took a break to have a baby.</p><p>She recently returned to the national team after having a baby in time for the FIFA Women's World Cup. Her reappearance in the team has sparked plastic surgery speculations about herself. Apparently, some people perceive that she has had cosmetic work done even though she mostly looks natural. She did look like she had fillers at one point but that time is long gone. Let's discuss Julie Ertz's plastic surgery!</p><p>Would you like to read more <strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Eddie Vedder</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Molly Mae</strong></a>?</p><h2>Julie Ertz's Plastic Surgery: She Was Rumored To Have Fillers Once!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/julie-ertz-pic1.jpg alt="Julie Ertz is suspected by her fans of having plastic surgery. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Julie Ertz is suspected by her fans of having plastic surgery.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The New York Times</strong></p><p><strong>Julie Ertz</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@julieertz</a>) has become the latest target of plastic surgery speculations following her return to the United States women's national team after her pregnancy. Her <a href=# rel=noopener>reappearance at FIFA Women's World Cup</a> so soon after she gave birth to her first child had everyone scrutinizing her looks and that intense scrutiny has led some of them to think that she might have had cosmetic work done. At one point, it looked like she had gotten <strong>fillers</strong>.</p><p>The whole plastic surgery rumor, when it comes to Julie Ertz, does not make much sense because, for one, she does not look like has ever had any work done because she looks very natural and for another, she is a sports personality which means that, unlike the women in the glam industry, she is not fixated on her looks, it's just her skills she needs to hone for her career, not her appearance. Not that people from the sports world never get plastic surgery but more of them don't go under the knife than they do.</p><p>And Julie Ertz definitely does not seem like she is the type to go under the knife. She is one of the best female footballers who has won the FIFA Women's World Cup twice, once in 2015 and another time in 2019. You don't get to be that great if you are not really dedicated to your career and if you don't spend every day training and honing your skills for your career. Anybody with that kind of dedication has a one-track mind. And they would not be focused on their appearance, much less get plastic surgery to alter their appearance.</p><p>Now, everyone wants to look great and I'm sure Julie Ertz is no exception to do that. But I'm also sure she wouldn't go so far as to get plastic surgery to change herself in any way. Besides, when would she get the time to do that? She's always busy and with a new baby at home, she's even more swamped than before. She has to train, she has to take care of her health and fitness, and she has to spend time and bond with her baby as well. She barely can manage time for that.</p><h2>Did Julie Ertz Have Plastic Surgery, Botox and Fillers in Particular?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/julie-ertz-pic2.jpg alt="Julie Ertz looked like she had fillers at one point but now, she looks natural. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Julie Ertz looked like she had fillers at one point but now, she looks natural.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Sports Illustrated</strong></p><p><strong>Julie Ertz</strong> definitely has no extra time to spare to pay a visit to a doctor and get plastic surgery to alter her looks, which does not need any alteration because she looks fine. I'll be the first one to admit that there was a point when she looked like she had fillers and gone overboard with it. In some of her pictures from that time, her lips are noticeably swollen and look unflatteringly big. But now, either she has dissolved the fillers or the fillers have settled down because she completely looks natural now.</p><p>However, fillers cannot technically be considered plastic surgery because it's non-invasive and there's no actually undergoing the knife. Also, it takes up less time so, it's not very hard for even Julie to make time for that one. Now, some may use that reasoning to push that she has had Botox as well. For some reason, some people think she has an uncanny valley plastic surgery look. But her forehead moves and it does not look suspiciously smooth because she has wrinkles and lines, so that's one easy to figure out.</p><p>Anyway, these are just speculations on the fans' part. Julie Ertz has never responded to any of the plastic surgery speculations about herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGihrqSZmnqmvtOzZKmkkajBqq%2BMrKyrn5WnxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dario-franchitti.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Former British Racing Driver, Dario Franchitti Is A Father Of Two">&larr;
