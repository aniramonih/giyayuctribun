He is probably best known as the fresh-faced, innocent young man who took on the role of Spider-Man in the first Sony trilogy – but there is more to Tobey Maguire than wholesome web-slinging. The vegan, sober superstar has had his share of controversy, including a backroom&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">poker game</a>&nbsp;and a battle with alcoholism that threatened to end his short career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hollywood-1024x671.jpg><p>Born in Santa Monica, California, on 28th June 1975, Maguire didn’t have the most leisurely start to life. His parents quickly married soon after his birth, but they split up, meaning that Maguire had to live between various family members in households in California, Washington, and Oregon.</p><table itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person class="infobox person"><tbody readability=14.529331514325><tr><th colspan=2>Tobey Maguire<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thecityceleb-verified-badge-png-e1603153818754.png alt="verify button" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></th></tr><tr readability=2><td colspan=2><img decoding=async itemprop=image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tobey-Maguire-Bio-Movies-Net-Worth-Age-Wife-Brothers-Instagram-Children.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Tobey Maguire: History ‧ Bio ‧ Photo</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2>Wiki Facts & About Data</th></tr><tr><td>Full Name:</td><td itemprop=name>Tobias Vincent Maguire</td></tr><tr><td>Stage Name:</td><td itemprop=alternateName>Tobey Maguire</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Born:</td><td itemprop=birthDate>27 June 1975 (age 48 years old)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place of Birth:</td><td itemprop=birthPlace>Santa Monica, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Education:</td><td itemprop=alumniOf>Young Actors Space</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td itemprop=nationality>American</td></tr><tr><td>Height:</td><td itemprop=height>1.72 m</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents:</td><td itemprop=parents>Wendy Brown, Vincent Maguire</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings:</td><td itemprop=siblings>Weston Epp, Sara Maguire, Jopaul Van Epp, Vincent Maguire Jr., Timothy Maguire</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse:</td><td itemprop=spouse>Jennifer Meyer (m. 2007-2017)</td></tr><tr readability=6.8354430379747><td>Girlfriend • Partner:</td><td itemprop=spouse>Tatiana Dieteman (2018-2021), <strong><a href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a></strong> (2001), Rashida Jones (1997-2000), Sara Gilbert (1993-1996), <strong><a href=#>Anne-Marie</a></strong>, Demi Moore (2002)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children:</td><td itemprop=children>Ruby Sweetheart Maguire, Otis Tobias Maguire</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation:</td><td itemprop=jobTitle>Actor • Filmmaker</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth:</td><td itemprop=netWorth>$75 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_and_Career></span>Early Life and Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At school, <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> showed up but was not present, failing to complete his education. Despite his dreams to become a chef, his mum pushed him into taking auditions – and he had some early success with feature films and advertisements.</p><p>As a youthful-looking actor, <strong>Maguire</strong> played teenagers until he was well into his twenties, and it was in the early ‘90s he started to recognise that the Hollywood party lifestyle was taking a roll on him. He sought help through Alcoholics Anonymous in 1995 and has remained sober since – which helped him to be able to secure his starring role in Spider-Man, which really saw his ascension to the big time in Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy</a>&nbsp;was released between 2002-2007, and while this was being filmed, he dipped his toe into the world of professional poker.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tobey_and_Poker_%E2%80%93_Mollys_Game></span>Tobey and Poker – Molly’s Game<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After seeking help from the professional poker player <strong>Daniel Negreanu</strong> in 2004, <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> took part in the World Series of Poker and was featured in the ESPN coverage of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Main Event Championships.&nbsp;</p><p>Around this time, he hooked up with poker player turned Hollywood producer <strong>Houston Curtis</strong> to organise poker games tailored to the rich (and potential easy targets) of fellow actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Much has been said about this period from various sources – and it is hard to tell which version is the truth – but we do know that <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> started playing these games from his home, enlisting his soon-to-be wife to play the part of hostess. The games soon moved to the infamous Viper Room in Hollywood, where every Tuesday night, the brightest and best in Hollywood were invited to try their hand at playing Texas Hold ‘Em against <strong>Maguire</strong> and <strong>Curtis</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thecityceleb-verified-badge-png-e1603153818754.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meeting_Molly_Bloom></span>Meeting Molly Bloom<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>These private, high-stakes poker games needed the perfect hostess; that is where&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Molly Bloom</a></strong>&nbsp;came in. Stunningly beautiful, the ex-Olympian soon became the focus of the events, contacting the right people to join in the organised games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong>Tobey Maguire</strong></strong> used his friendship with <strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a></strong> as a lure – staking <strong><a href=#>DiCaprio</a></strong> for games to tempt other Hollywood names to come and play. With $200-$300 blinds in these private games, it was not unusual for the unsuspecting actors and other stars to lose millions in one night.&nbsp;</p><p>How this happened – and whether <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> just wanted to play poker or was a conniving bad guy hellbent on bankrupting other A-Listers – is the subject of <strong><a href=#>Molly Bloom</a></strong>’s book&nbsp;Molly’s Game&nbsp;and the film of the same name. In both, the character that represents<strong> Maguire</strong> is shown to be shrewd, conning and bluffing his way to everyone else’s riches.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the truth is, every Tuesday night at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Viper Room</a>&nbsp;or in the Beverley Hills Four Seasons Hotel, <strong><a href=#>Bloom</a></strong>, <strong>Maguire</strong>, and <strong>Curtis</strong> would welcome people like <strong><a href=#>DiCaprio</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Ben Affleck</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Matt Damon</a></strong> to come and play.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> met and married <strong>Jennifer Meyer</strong>, the daughter of Universal Studios’ head, shortly after their daughter <strong>Ruby Sweetheart Maguire</strong> was born in 2006. They then had a son named <strong>Otis Tobias Maguire</strong> in 2009 but separated in 2016, and <strong>Meyer</strong> filed for divorce in 2020.</p><p>Despite his turbulent home life stopping him from completing his schooling, he did manage to achieve his GED – and has always been a proponent of good education, no matter what. Alongside his sobriety, <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> became a vegetarian in 1992 and went full vegan in 2009 – when he got his first Golden Globe nomination for his work on the film Brothers with <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> and <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Latest_News_on_Tobey_Maguire></span>Latest News on Tobey Maguire<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Spider-Man fans were all astonished to see the well-kept secret cameo that <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong> had in Spider-Man: No Way Home, where an incident with the multiverse saw three different Spider-Man iterations working together to save the world (again) – and <strong>Maguire</strong> got to feature alongside <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong> and <strong><a href=#>Tom Holland</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than that, <strong>Maguire</strong> has worked on several movies, including The Great Gatsby with <strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a></strong>, a starring role in Seabiscuit, and was in Cider House Rules, too.&nbsp;</p><p>His latest movie is Babylon, with <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Margot Robbie</a></strong>, which came out in 2022.</p><h5>NOTICE!!
