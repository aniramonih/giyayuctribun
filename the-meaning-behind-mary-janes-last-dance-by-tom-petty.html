They also produced some impressive material like the track&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“The End Of The Line</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>.</strong>” We are going to take a look at just one song from his time with The Heartbreakers.

It was released as a single and reached #14 in America, his first Top 20 track of the 1990s.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=In_The_Strangest_Places></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In The Strangest Places</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>People write their songs in the strangest of places.&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance”</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>&nbsp;</strong>was written in the garage of his guitarist Mike Campbell. The basic idea for the song had been around in his mind for a while before it was finally completed.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A lot of songwriters choose random phrases to represent the hook of a song while it is being written. Sometimes, even before it has a title, this is one such song, and Petty used the phrase “Indiana Girl” while it was being finished. Even though the final title and chorus were finished shortly after, the “Indiana Girl” references still stayed in the song.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Mary_Jane_Exist></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Does Mary Jane Exist?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Does-Mary-Jane-Exist.png alt="Does Mary Jane Exist" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This is one of those songs where the writer has never undertaken a full explanation as to the meaning of the lyrics. Because of that, people have tried to interpret the meaning of the songs. Casting aside the more preposterous suggestions, there are two&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>potential meanings to&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;to choose from.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Toms_Marriage_To_Jane></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tom’s Marriage To Jane</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The first meaning that has been offered relates to his marriage to his ex-wife Jane Benyo. Tom and Jane had both grown up in Gainesville, Florida, and had been teenage sweethearts. They married in 1974 and divorced in 1996.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was Jane who had talked to Stevie Nicks about her and Tom being 17 when they started to get serious. From a misheard conversation came Nick’s song&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Edge of Seventeen</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>.</strong>”</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_First_Option></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The First Option</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At the time of the writing of&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>,</strong>” Tom and Jane were having problems. There were angry phone calls between them, and the rest of the band was aware of the situation. If the song is about their relationship, then there are a couple of problems.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The first is that given the song was written at a time when the situation was becoming untenable, they weren’t divorced until three years after the single’s release. That just seems a little too long if it was her the song was written about.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Secondly, Jane was brought up and lived in Gainesville. The&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>lyrics of&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;makes mention that she “Moved down here” when she was eighteen. She wouldn’t need to move; she was already there. This first option has got too many holes in it to be a&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>real meaning bend&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance”</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Second_Option></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Second Option</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To me, this seems a lot more credible. Mary Jane, as we all know, is slang for marijuana. The song could be using the slang word to describe how he was introduced to the drug but inferring it was a woman.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Petty was known to appreciate marijuana, and so that idea has some credibility. There are other subtle clues as well. Marijuana is used in some places in a clinical environment to ease the pain. In ordinary people’s lives, they may have spoken about marijuana helping them come through difficult and painful times.</span></p><p><strong>The song is constantly referring to this…&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He talks about having a last dance with Mary Jane. And that one more dance will kill the pain. One more smoke will help him forget whatever it was that was on his mind.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To me, they seem like obvious references. But, some would argue for a talented songwriter like Petty, they are too obvious. Maybe with this song, he didn’t want to be over cryptic. Marijuana, remember, was still an illegal drug and criminalized in a lot of American states at the time. Maybe he buried the word in symbolistic expression deliberately.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Curious_About_the_Meaning_Behind_Other_Famous_Songs></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Curious About the Meaning Behind Other Famous Songs?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If so, check out our thoughts on the&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meaning Behind “Edge of Seventeen” Song By Stevie Nicks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Meaning Behind “House of the Rising Sun” by The Animals</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Meaning Behind “When Doves Cry” by Prince</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Meaning Behind “Scar Tissue” by Red Hot Chili Peppers</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and the&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meaning Behind “In The Air Tonight” by Phil Collins</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;for more insights and analysis.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_Behind_%E2%80%9CMary_Janes_Last_Dance%E2%80%9D_By_Tom_Petty_%E2%80%93_Final_Thought></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Meaning Behind&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance”</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;By Tom Petty – Final Thought</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Whatever the&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>real meaning of Tom Petty’s “Mary Jane’s Last Dance”</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;is, we may never really know.
