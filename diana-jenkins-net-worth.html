She owns a business and donates to charitable organizations. She is currently residing in California. Jenkins fled her homeland when Sarajevo was attacked. She relocated to London and attended City University.</p><h2><strong>Diana Jenkins Early Life</strong></h2><p>Diana Jenkins was born Sanela Dijana ati in Sarajevo in 1973. She was the eldest of two children born into a middle-class family. Her parents both worked in business; her father was an economist and her mother was an accountant.<br>The family lived in a simple concrete apartment building at the time, which was a common type of structure in Yugoslavia during the communist era.</p><p>Irnis, Diana’s younger brother, was killed by Serb forces when he was only 21 years old. This tragic occurrence occurred. Diana was a student at Sarajevo University when her boyfriend was murdered there.</p><p>She came to study economics. As a result of the outbreak of conflict, she was forced to flee Bosnia in April 1992, during the siege of Sarajevo. The conflict began with the dissolution of Yugoslavia. A bloody conflict raged on until December of 1995.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Sanela Diana Jenkins (@sdjneuro)</a></p><p>Jenkins spent more than a year as a refugee in Croatia before relocating to London, England. Jenkins eventually relocated to London. She was eventually allowed to resume her studies at City University in London after a two-year absence.</p><p>Diana made the wise decision to focus her studies on mathematics rather than English because understanding numbers do not require a strong command of the language. She eventually received a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in both Economics and Computer Science.</p><p>Despite the fact that many of her fellow Yugoslavian refugees were not, Diana was granted permanent citizenship around this time. This was due to her outstanding academic record as well as the fact that she had never requested any type of government assistance.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Diane Jenkins Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p>Diana Jenkins’ estimated net worth is <strong>$300 million.</strong></p><p>Being an entrepreneur has provided her with financial security and success.

She is the brains behind the health drink company “Neuro Drinks.” Melissa Odabash is also the founder of the swimwear company.</p><table class="table table-col-2"><tbody><tr><td>Birth Year</td><td>1973</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Bosnia And Herzegovina</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>48 YEARS OLD</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth:</td><td>$300 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Gender:</td><td>Female</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Who Is Diana’s Ex-Husband?</strong></h2><p>Sanela Diana Jenkins married Roger Jenkins, a British bank financier, in 1999, and the couple was married until their divorce in 2011.
