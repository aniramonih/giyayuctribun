Furthermore, Tyrod has a flawlessly toned, attractive figure as a result of all his gym and exercise sessions. He has gorgeous, warm black eyes, and his hair is black. His dress size, shoe size, biceps, chest, waist, hips, and other physical characteristics are all unknown.</p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>He played collegiate football for Virginia Tech, where he helped the Hokies win the 2009 and 2011 Orange Bowls as a senior. He was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft and acted as Joe Flacco’s backup, including during the Ravens’ triumph against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII.</li><li>In the third quarter of a victory against the Houston Texans in Week 13, Taylor established the team record for consecutive throws without an interception for the Buffalo Bills. The previous record had been held by Drew Bledsoe since 2002. The streak came to an end in Week 14’s defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on the game’s final pass (222).</li><li>The Bills lost to the Washington Redskins 35-25 the very following week, eliminating them from postseason contention. In Week 16, Taylor became the first quarterback for the Bills to have more than 500 rushing yards in a season and established the team record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a season. For the first time ever, the Bills ended the season 8-8. since the late 1990s, 500 or more years without interruption.</li><li>On September 8, 2007, Taylor played in his first collegiate football game against the LSU Tigers. In the game, Taylor completed 7-of-18 throws for 62 yards and carried for 44 yards on nine tries including his first collegiate score. Tyrod was selected as the starter by head coach Frank Beamer following that contest. Tyrod passed for 287 yards and a running score in his first college start versus Ohio.</li><li>Taylor was going to redshirt when the 2008 season began. However, his redshirt was removed after Virginia Tech’s defeat to East Carolina University because the Hokies needed more offense. In his first game of the year, Taylor ran for 112 yards and a score against Furman in the second contest of the year. The next week, he made his debut as a sophomore against Georgia Tech.</li><li>The Baltimore Ravens selected Taylor with the 180th overall selection in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He was chosen that year as the 11th quarterback. The St. Louis Rams traded the choice to the Ravens in exchange for Mark Clayton, who was moved to St. Louis. Even though many of the other 31 teams thought he belonged as wide receiver instead, the Ravens started him at quarterback.</li><li>Taylor had extensive playing time on December 30, 2012, as Flacco was rested for most of the Week 17 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored the first touchdown of his career on a one-yard bootleg. Taylor did, however, also throw a significant interception to defensive end Carlos Dunlap, who then scored a touchdown on it. The Ravens lost the game against the Bengals by a score of 23–17. Taylor finally earned a championship ring as a backup when the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII.</li><li>Taylor and the Buffalo Bills agreed to a three-year, $3.35 million deal on March 12, 2015. After a preseason quarterback duel between Taylor, veteran Matt Cassel, and previous Bills first-round selection EJ Manuel, Taylor was chosen by head coach Rex Ryan on August 31, 2015, as the team’s starting quarterback for the 2015 season.</li><li>Taylor and fellow center Eric Wood was chosen for the Pro Bowl on January 25, 2016. They replaced Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and Panthers center Ryan Kalil, who was playing in Super Bowl 50. Taylor completed 8 of his 14 attempts for 120 yards and a score at the Pro Bowl, but he also threw three interceptions.</li><li>Taylor was traded by the Bills to the Cleveland Browns on March 9, 2018, in exchange for a third-round draft selection 2018. Five days later, on March 14, the first day of the NFL season, the agreement was made official.</li><li>On March 13, 2019, Taylor reconnected with former offensive coordinator and former interim head coach Anthony Lynn when he signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Los Angeles Chargers. Taylor replaced Philip Rivers in Week 14’s 45-10 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, and he hit Virgil Green for a 14-yard touchdown throw.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tyrod-Taylor-2-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Records</h2><ul><li>Highest completion percentage (91.7%) in a single game</li><li>Most consecutive pass attempts (222) without an interception</li><li>Highest career passer rating (92.5), 500 or more passes thrown</li><li>Highest career completion percentage (62.6), 500 or more passes thrown</li><li>First quarterback to post back-to-back seasons with over 500 yards rushing (2015–16)</li><li>First quarterback to post back-to-back-to-back seasons with over 400 yards rushing (2015–17)</li><li>Most rushing yards (79) in a game by a quarterback</li><li>Most rushing yards (580) in a season by a quarterback</li><li>Most career rushing yards (1,575) by a quarterback</li></ul><h2>Tyrod Taylor’s Net Worth</h2><p>The footballer now has a net worth of around $1.6 million as of October 2023.
