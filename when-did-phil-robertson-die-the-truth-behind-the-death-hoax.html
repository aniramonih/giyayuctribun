He rose to fame as the patriarch of the Robertson family on the hit show Duck Dynasty, which aired on A&E from 2012 to 2017. He is also the founder of the Duck Commander company, which produces duck calls and other hunting merchandise.</p><p>But in February 2024, a shocking rumor spread online that Phil Robertson had died at the age of 77. The news was apparently confirmed by a website called Necropedia, which claimed to be an obituary site. The site posted a brief article stating that Phil Robertson had passed away on February 27, 2024, and offered condolences to his family and fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did the Death Hoax Start?</h2><p>The death hoax was likely a result of a malicious prank or a clickbait scheme. Necropedia is not a reliable source of information, as it is a satire site that generates fake obituaries for celebrities who are still alive. The site even has a disclaimer at the bottom of its page that reads: “This is a fake news article. Phil Robertson is not dead.”</p><p>However, some people may have been fooled by the site’s realistic design and the use of the word “necro”, which means death in Greek. The site also has a feature that allows users to create their own obituaries for celebrities, which may have been used to fabricate the story about Phil Robertson.</p><p>The death hoax was also fueled by the fact that Phil Robertson had been out of the public eye for a while, as he had retired from Duck Dynasty in 2017 and focused on his podcast, Unashamed with Phil Robertson, and his YouTube channel, In the Woods with Phil. He had also faced some controversies in the past, such as his homophobic and racist remarks in a 2013 interview with GQ magazine, which led to his temporary suspension from the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Phil Robertson React to the Death Hoax?</h2><p>Phil Robertson was unaware of the death hoax until his son, Willie Robertson, called him to check on him. Willie told Fox News that he had received a text message from a friend asking if his father was okay, and he was confused by the question. He then searched online and found the fake obituary, and immediately called his father to make sure he was alive.</p><p>Phil Robertson was surprised by the news, but he was not bothered by it. He said that he was used to being the target of false rumors and attacks, and that he was more concerned about his eternal life than his earthly one. He said that he was happy and healthy, and that he was looking forward to meeting his Lord and Savior when his time came.</p><p>He also joked that he was glad that the death hoax had given him some publicity, and that he hoped that it would help him sell more books and duck calls. He said that he was grateful for his fans and supporters, and that he hoped that they would not believe everything they read on the internet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Phil Robertson is not dead. He is still alive and well, and enjoying his life in Louisiana with his wife, Kay, and his five children and 18 grandchildren. He is still active in his hunting and fishing hobbies, and in his Christian ministry. He is also still involved in the entertainment industry, as he has appeared in several documentaries and films, such as The Blind, which was released in September 2023 and chronicled his early life and faith journey.</p><p>Phil Robertson is a legend in the hunting and reality TV world, and he has inspired millions of people with his humor, wisdom, and faith. He is not afraid of death, but he is not ready to go yet. He has a lot more to offer to the world, and he is not going to let a death hoax stop him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfrLWmuoydoJ1loJ22rXnRqJmeqqSovK95w6KcZqyYmnq1vtStn2aalZ22r7CMrZ%2BeZZSarrW0jKGmmrBf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-julissa-sanchez-seeking-information-on-the-disappearance-of-julissa-sanchez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Julissa Sanchez?
