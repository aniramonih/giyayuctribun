The talented musician was born Caresha Romeka Brownlee on February 11, 1994, in Miami, Florida. Her birth sign is Aquarius and given the fact that she was born in the United States, she is as an American citizen. Yung Miami belongs to the African American ethnic group.</p><p>Yung Miami does not really talk about her father, but she has never shied away from letting people know who her mother is. The musician is the only child of ex-convict, Keenya Young, who was recently released from prison after serving a five-year jail sentence for attempted murder.</p><p>The resemblance between Yung Miami and her daughter is uncanny, and an uninformed person could easily mistake them for sisters, a situation that suggests that her mother had her when she was very young.</p><p>The well-endowed musician spent her formative years in Miami, Florida. Details of her formal education background include the fact that she attended Carol City Middle School, but several reports have confirmed the fact that she dropped out of high school to actively pursue her music career.</p><p>Nothing about her life suggests that she got a GED or that she later acquired a college degree.</p><h2><strong>Yung Miami Is A Talented Musician</strong></h2><p>Yung Miami has always been passionate about music from a very young age and as previously mentioned, that passion contributed to her decision to drop out of school. Afterward, she linked up with fellow rapper JT (real name: Jatavia Shakara Johnson), and together they formed the hip-hop group known today as City Girls.</p><p>Although the public got to know more about them after their guest appearance in Drake’s 2018 music video, In My Feelings, they had begun recording and releasing songs the previous year. In 2017, they released their first track, Fuck Dat Nigga, a track they released to get back at their ex-boyfriends for refusing them money when they asked for it.</p><p>They released the music video for the song in January 2018 and it featured rapper, Trina. Shortly after the release of the song, Yung Miami’s partner, JT, was arrested and charged with aggravated identity theft. She ended up spending 24 months in prison from July 2018 to March 2020. While she was incarcerated Miami continued to promote their music through various mediums, including going to strip clubs and paying DJs $20 to play the songs.</p><p>After signing to Quality Control Music in 2018, they released their debut mixtape ‘Period’ along with studio albums ‘Girl Code’ and ‘City on Lock.’ Girl Code had songs such as Twerk and Act Up. The talented Yung Miami worked with JT for several years before dropping her first solo single Rap Freaks on October 29, 2021.</p><p>She released the video the same year and referred to several rappers such as Diddy, Megan Thee Stallion, and Meek Mill. It was Yung Miami’s first entry as a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 81 on the charts. Below is a select list of Yung Miami’s discography.</p><ul><li>2017 – Fuck Dat Nigga</li><li>2018 – Where The Bag At</li><li>2019 – Come On</li><li>2019 – JT First Day Out</li><li>2019 – Act Up</li><li>2019 – You Tried It</li><li>2020 – Pussy Talk</li><li>2020 – Jobs</li><li>2021 – Throat Baby</li><li>2021 – Twerkulator</li></ul><h2><strong>Yung Miami Has A Healthy Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Yung Miami has done well for herself financially. From the humble beginnings of having to pay a DJ $20 to promote her music, she has grown to the point where she is now one of the most recognized rappers in the United States with a net worth estimated to be around $5 million.</p><p>However, not all of her income comes from her career as a musician. She is also an actress best known for her appearance in several music videos and the TV series, Respectfully Justin. Her responsibilities as a social media influencer and a brand ambassador for several brands, including Fashion Nova, also contribute significantly to her net worth.</p><h2><strong>Yung Miami Is In An Open Relationship With Diddy</strong></h2><p>During an interview with XL, the rapper admitted that she was in an open relationship with popular American rapper, Diddy. They reportedly began seeing each other in June 2021 and have been seen together in public on several occasions, including at Pierre “Pee” Thomas’ birthday party in Atlanta where they were seen holding hands.</p><p>Despite their quite open relationship, the couple has never been ashamed of showing their affection in public. This led to the impression that they were in an exclusive relationship. Miami’s declaration to the contrary changed those views.</p><p>Before linking up romantically with Diddy, Miami was in a relationship with Jai Wiggins. They began their relationship in May 2010 and were together until 2015 when the rapper ended the relationship because Wiggins was being physically abusive to her. The former couple welcomed a son named Jai Malik Wiggins Jr. on June 26, 2013.</p><p>The father of Miami’s first child was shot and killed in 2020 but before that development, she had begun another relationship with rapper Southside (real name: Joshua Howard Luellen). They began dating in 2018 and were together until 2020. While dating Southside, Yung Miami took in and had her daughter Summer Miami Luellen on October 18, 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLWww4yoo51lmah6usHNoGSmoZGitm6tjKWmqKNdlsFutMSrZJqflWKur7CMn6ylpF2XtrCz0ZqnobFf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./katie-mcgrath-4971-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How tall is Katie McGrath">&larr;
