However, the songstress never enjoyed marital bliss until she met her second spouse, who was "so different" and blessed her with the "gift of life."</p><p class=Fg>Tina Turner, aka the "Queen of Rock and Roll," was a sensational singer who rose to fame in the 1950s. As a beautiful young singer, she matched her energy with the talented Ike Turner after meeting him at a nightclub in Manhattan.</p><p class=Fg>In no time, the duo became a force to be reckoned with, singing and performing with their duo known as "Tina and Ike Turner."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/de48da22c6ad899f06d146695d63ea98.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Photo of Tina Turner and Ike Turner in London in 1975 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Apart from making music, the pair's interest in each other intensified. Soon, they became romantically involved, despite the five years gap between Tina and Ike. For the upbeat powerhouse, being smitten by her, a man younger than her never got in the way of their love affair.</p><p class=Fg>A few years down the line, she traveled with Ike to Tijuana, Mexico, where they exchanged marital vows. This became the beginning of another journey for the celebrity couple.</p><p class=Fg>What many thought was a blissful union between like minds turned out to be the worst moment for the Queen of Rock and Roll. Decades after her divorce from Ike, Tina confessed that the relationship was plagued with verbal and physical abuse.</p><p class=Fg>In her book "My Love Story," she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/2589022/how-long-was-tina-turner-married-to-ike/>explained</a> that her ex-husband hated any form of confrontation. So whenever there was a minor argument or he felt offended, she was in for a beating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/75e2f21384790c3fb03302dc7dcd4be1.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Ike and Tina Turner became a R&B success as the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. Circa 1966. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>This continued for more than a decade. However, in 1976, Tina realized that it was best to leave the abusive marriage. Two years after the separation, the couple divorced.</p><p class=Fg>Thankfully, Tina had the chance to experience true love again. This time, in the arms of a music executive, Erwin Bach.</p><p class=Fg>Although she was not thinking of being in another relationship when she met Bach, he stuck around long enough, and the pair ended up creating the most charming love story.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Tina Fell For "So Different" Erwin First While He Didn't</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/33d23a8bf3a9fa49f858150324ddde8a.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Turner of the husband-and-wife R&B duo Ike & Tina Turner poses for a portrait in 1964. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Then 47-year-old Tina met who she thought was her prince charming in a story similar to a rom-com. Bach had been contracted to pick her up from the airport before a show.</p><p class=Fg>Immediately Tina saw the then 30-year-old music executive from EMI; his looks instantly smote her. He had barely opened his mouth to talk, but the singer knew that he was special. In her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>words</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"He had the prettiest face. You could not miss it. My heart went bu-bum. It means that a soul has met. My hands were shaking. And Roger said to me, 'Tina, you ride with Erwin,' and I wanted to go, 'Yay!'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c47bcfe165ee78016049ebbd6bdf376b.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Turner and Erwin Bach on July 31,1999. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Tina confessed that the atmosphere was not set in a way that should have triggered her emotions. She could have worried about her concert in Germany and dismissed the attraction she felt for the music executive, but it was impossible.</p><p class=Fg>She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>said</a>: "Even then, I could have ignored what I feltâ€”I could have listened to the ghost voices in my head telling me that I didn't look good that day, or that I shouldn't be thinking about romance because it never ends well. Instead, I listened to my heart. I left my comfort zone and made it a priority to get to know Erwin."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1de3cd98dfd27a5ee5f090648435b151.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Singer Tina Turner performs live on stage at Wembley Stadium, in 1990. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Once she was certain about her attraction toward Bach, she proposed a future meeting in the US, which Bach honored.

While recalling the moment, Tina <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>mentioned</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"He was just so different, so laid back, so comfortable, so unpretentious, and that was the beginning of our relationship."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/044f38ea230c4a76499cdf033a910120.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Erwin Bach and Tina Turner arrive at the press night performance of "Tina: The Tina Turner Musical" at the Aldwych Theatre on April 17, 2018 in London, England. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>However, it was not love at first sight for Bach. Still, Bach revealed that their relationship was built on love for each other, adding that it thrived on the same foundation. <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a35978874/who-is-erwin-bach-tina-turner-husband/>He said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"It's love.

Instead, she gave an ambiguous response because she didn't believe he was committed. Then, while reminiscing about the proposal, she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I said, 'I don't have an answer.' It wasn't yes, it wasn't no. Marriage says ownership. I didn't want that 'my' anything, anymore. I had enough of that."</p><p class=Fg>Despite the uncertainty, Bach remained unwavering in his affection toward the famous singer, and nearly three decades later, she said yes!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/87450cce29ae6e5d0ed4a777e588ddea.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Turner and Erwin Bach attend the Giorgio Armani 40th Anniversary Boutique Cocktail Reception on April 29, 2015 in Milan, Italy. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The couple married in 2013 at their stunningly decorated Swiss estate.

Speaking about the ceremony, the singer <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I wanted to be the best I could be. I wanted my garden and my guests to be the best they could be. And they were."</p><p class=Fg>Furthermore, she complimented her husband for being confident in himself. The singer <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a35978874/who-is-erwin-bach-tina-turner-husband/>described </a>him as:</p><p class=Fg>"A force of nature in his own right, has never been the least bit intimidated by my career, my talents, or my fame."</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Moving To Switzerland</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Tina's wedding venue in Switzerland had been home to the couple for many years. They enjoyed their lake-side home in the Zurich suburb of Kuesnacht. The singer's abode, named "Chateau Algonquin," provided a "cartoon palace energy."</p><p class=Fg>An NYT <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>description</a> of the home is that: "The home, which overlooks Lake Zurich, has ivy snaking up the walls, gardeners manicuring the shrubs, a life-size two-legged horse sculpture suspended from a domed ceiling, a framed rendering of Turner as an Egyptian queen, [and] a room stuffed with gilded Louis XIV style sofas."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7a81abcc7c562e6fd912502e237d7fbb.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Turner | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Tina, who <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2268405/Tina-Turner-renounces-American-citizenship-Swiss.html>retired </a>from performing in 2009, was overwhelmed by the peace and privacy she got in the country. Although she had some family in the US, the singer labeled Switzerland as her home. She admitted:</p><p class=Fg>"I am very happy in Switzerland and I feel at home here. I could not imagine a better place to live."</p><p class=Fg>The singer once opened up about what influenced her decision to relocate. She explained that her boyfriend-turned-husband lived there and that her music was more accepted in Europe than in America. In an interview with Larry King, she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/UgtEeU_DDWY>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I'm as big as Madonna in Europe.

Through their relationship and marriage, they remained supportive of each other. Indeed, the German native proved to be a loving partner whose priority was to protect his leading lady from as much hurt as possible.</p><p class=Fg>Bach was present through Tina's health challenges. In 2016, she was diagnosed with kidney cancer and had the option of regular dialysis or a transplant. In her memoir, Tina <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"Only the transplant would give me a good chance of a near-normal life. But the chances of getting a donor kidney were remote."</p><p class=Fg>That was when Bach did something extraordinary; he offered to give her one of his kidneys. The "Proud Mary" singer <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>recalled</a> that:</p><p class=Fg>"He said he didn't want another woman, or another life. Then he shocked me. He said he wanted to give me one of his kidneys."</p><p class=Fg>Fortunately, the kidney transplant was a success; she was grateful to her beau for giving her the "gift of life," a gesture she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a35878496/tina-turner-erwin-bach-relationship-timeline/>believed</a> showed the world how genuine their love story seemed.</p><p class=Fg>Tina also felt "happy, overwhelmed and relieved that we'd come through this alive." But unfortunately, shortly after this life-changing experience, the Queen of Rock and Roll lost her first child, Craig Turner.</p><p class=Fg>Craig was her son from a previous relationship before she met Ike. However, Ike adopted him. Sadly, he died by suicide in 2018.</p><p class=Fg>The singer kept reminiscing about her son and labeled the incident as her "saddest" moment. Tina once shared a photo where she was held by Bach while mourning the deceased.</p><p class=Fg>An accompanying caption <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.whas11.com/article/features/entertainment/tina-turner-shares-tribute-to-late-son-who-died-earlier-this-month/417-578293030>read</a>: "My saddest moment as a mother.
