The new season is right around the corner, and the coaches are gearing up for one music-filled thrill ride. A new promo recently dropped that teased “Reba, Niall, Gwen, and John are taking the reins” this season.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In another promo, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a> celebrates his first win as a coach with a special cake. Niall quips it’s “good to be king” of The Voice. However, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong> </a>warns that this season is a “whole new ballgame.”<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> John Legend</strong></a> notes that they “miss the cowboy,” a.k.a. <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Blake Shelton</a>,</strong> but says they might have a chance at the best country artists in season 24. Suddenly, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reba McEntire</strong></a> shows up and makes a grand entrance. She’s ready to take her place as the country queen of The Voice!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>NBC confirmed during the network’s upfront presentation on May 15 that the hit musical competition series would return for season 24. The show has also been renewed for a milestone 25th season. So, who are going to be the coaches of The Voice season 24? What about season 25? Why aren’t Voice fan faves <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> coming back? <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything you need to know about The Voice season 24.</p><h2>Who Are The Coaches Of The Voice Season 24?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Voice season 24 coaches will be <strong>Reba </strong><strong>McEntire</strong>, <strong>John </strong><strong>Legend</strong>, <strong>Niall </strong><strong>Horan</strong>, and<strong> Gwen</strong><strong> Stefani</strong>. This will mark Reba’s first season as a coach. The country music legend served as a mega mentor in season 23.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Reba celebrated the announcement by posting a video of a red chair with her name on it. “There’s a new Coach in town! See you all this Fall!&nbsp;#TheVoice,” she captioned the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>John, Niall, and Gwen are all returning coaches. This will be Niall’s second year as a coach. John took a break during season 23 after serving as a coach for seasons 16 through 22. The Voice season 24 will be Gwen’s sixth as a coach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-voice-season-24-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Niall posted a similar video as Reba on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram page</a> and wrote, “I loved it so much, I’m doing it again ! See you Fall 2023 on&nbsp;@nbcthevoice.” Gwen did the same thing and captioned her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>, “surprise :) i’m back in the big red chair !! see u all this fall 2023 #thevoice :) gx.”</p><h2>Why Did Blake Shelton & Kelly Clarkson Leave The Voice?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>Blake Shelton</strong> and<strong> Kelly Clarkson</strong> are the notable names not returning as coaches for The Voice season 24. Blake announced back in October 2022 that he would be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leaving The Voice</a> after season 23.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“I’ve been wrestling with this for a while and I’ve decided that it’s time for me to step away from&nbsp;The Voice after next season,” his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram announcement</a> began. “This show has changed my life in every way for the better and it will always feel like home to me. It’s been a hell of a ride over these 12 years of chair turns and I want to thank everyone at The Voice from NBC, every producer, the writers, musicians, crew and catering people, you are the best. It takes a lot of work, passion, and adult beverages (Ha!) to pull off a live show twice a week. I’ve made lifelong bonds with Carson and every single one of my fellow coaches over the years, including my wife Gwen Stefani!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Blake continued, “I have to give a huge shoutout to the singers — the ‘Voices,’ who come on this stage season after season and amaze us with their talent and a special thanks to those who chose me to be their coach. Lastly, it’s about y’all, the fans, who watch and support these artists, us coaches, and everyone at The Voice who are chasing their dreams. It would not happen without you!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-voice-season-24-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Blake was one of the original coaches of The Voice alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a>, and<strong> CeeLo Green.</strong> He has been a coach for every season of The Voice ahead of season 24.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>In a January 2023 interview, Blake revealed that part of the reason why he decided to leave The Voice was because he wanted to dedicate more of his time to being a stepdad to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gwen’s children</a>. “I think being a stepdad has changed my perspective in that I’m not the first person that I think about anymore,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Access</a>. “Even to the small little things when you go, ‘I think I’ll do this,’ the very next thought is always,‘Well, wait a minute. How’s that going work?’ Or, ‘What will they think?’ Or, ‘How will that affect a schedule?'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>He added, “I think the only way for me to really do that right is to step away from being committed to something like The Voice that demands a lot of your time. There’s no way around it. If you’re going to do it and do it right, you have to be 150 percent in. And I just feel like those days are behind me for now. I got a more important job.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-voice-season-24-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-21>Kelly joined The Voice in season 14 as a coach. She took a break during season 22 but returned for season 23. The American Idol winner is making a big move in the fall of 2023. Her Emmy-winning daytime talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, will be moving to New York City, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. Given that her talk show’s fifth season will premiere in the fall, it wouldn’t be possible for her to be a coach for The Voice, which is based in Los Angeles.</p><h2>When Will The Voice Season 24 Premiere?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>The Voice season 24 will premiere Sept. 25 at 8 p.m. on NBC. The show will continue to air on Mondays and Tuesdays. Episodes will be available to stream the next day on Peacock.</p><h2>Who Are The Coaches For The Voice Season 25?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>NBC announced on June 22 that country duo <strong>Dan+Shay</strong> would join The Voice as the show’s first-ever coaching duo in season 25, which will air in spring 2024. <strong>Reba McEntire</strong>,<strong> John Legend</strong>, and <strong>Chance the Rapper</strong> will return to their red chairs for The Voice season 25. Dan+Shay previously served as <strong>Blake Shelton’s</strong> Battle Advisors in season 20</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhnGaun56wpnnSnpisp55if3V5lGlwcm9hZnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-evolution-of-the-doctors-sonic-screwdriver.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Evolution Of The Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver">&larr;
