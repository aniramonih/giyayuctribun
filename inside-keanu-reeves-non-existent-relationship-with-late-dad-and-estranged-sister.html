The 58-year-old Canadian actor kick-started his career with 1989’s 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure', and went on to play pivotal roles in blockbusters including <a href=#>‘John Wick’</a>, ‘Matrix’ and ‘Henry’s Crime’. Reeves today shines bright among top Hollywood celebrities, with a total net worth of $380 million.</p><p>Despite garnering humungous success in his career, <a href=#>the ‘Speed‘ star</a> manages to be a down-to-earth man, who is a loving boyfriend, son, and brother. From his mom, <a href=#>Patricia Taylor</a>, Reeves has two sisters, Kim, 56, and Karina, 47. The actor shares a special bond with Kim, for whom he halted his career. 'The Colour of Water' actress was diagnosed with deadly blood cancer Leukemia in 1991. Following the diagnosis, Reeves became her primary caregiver, held her hand the entire time, and helped her through recovery after a decade of struggling with the illness. He even sold his house and delayed 'The Matrix' sequels to take care of his sister, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amomama.</a></p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>'Came out of left field': Keanu Reeves SHOCKED by Matthew Perry's jibes in new memoir</a></p><p><a href=#>'It's been insane': Couple whose wedding Keanu Reeves crashed delighted at newfound fame</a></p><h2 class=split>Why Keanu Reeves abandoned Emma Rose?</h2><p>However, despite having a strong bond with Kim, Reeves has a non-existent relationship with his youngest half-sister, Emma Reeves. Emma was born in 1980 after Reeves’ late father Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr began another relationship with a woman in Hawaii, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hollywood Life</a> reported. Reeves was only a toddler when his mother left Samuel because of his stint with drug use and addiction. However, Emma and her half-brother do not seem to have a close relationship as they barely talk to each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/17e0620c-2863-4182-8fdb-5a5798aaffbc.52090585><p>In a 2003 interview, Emma stated that she would like to get to know her brother more personally. “I would love to have a relationship with Keanu. I don’t want anything from him — not money, not fame by association — just to get to know my big brother,” she said at the time, according to Hollywood life. “I see all his films and read all the articles about him, but it’s not the same as being part of his life.” While Emma has been open about building a bond with her brother, Reeves has never spoken about the topic. However, not much is known about Emma as she lives a very low-key life with no photos available of her.</p><h2 class=split>Keanu Reeves' relationship with his estranged father</h2><p>Reeves has not publicly discussed the reasons why he is still estranged from his younger sister, but it is said that he chose to stay away from her because of his relationship with his father. Reeves’ relationship with Samuel soured after he left his family when Kim and Keanu were just kids. The last time Keanu spoke to his father, he was thirteen years old. The actor never spoke about their relationship in public but in the 90s when Samuel was arrested for drug possession, Reeves told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rolling Stone, </a>"It's his life, man. I hope he's well. Whatever that means."</p><p>In spite of his father's efforts to reach out to him, the 'Chain Reaction' actor admitted that his and his dad's narrative was filled with anguish, misery, and loss. Samuel blamed himself for the breakdown of his connection with his son, stating that his erratic behavior and drug use further strained their already strained bond. He confessed to <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Thing</a> that it pained him when his son described his life as terrible and that he had no idea things would have spiraled out of control. Despite his relentless efforts, Samuel failed to fix the bridges between him and his son before his death in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooZ6otqWxjKScmqalYr%2BmsdWeqmamn6N6psTIrKuepqRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedaiq6FlnJbBpnnDmptmmZ6Zeqa%2F06uYp5%2BVmXq0tdKtnKs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-dennis-basso-married-dennis-basso-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Dennis Basso Married?
