He was also to pay child support of $25,000.</p><p>After paying the sum for a few years, in 2011, Fraser went back to court to contest the alimony, requesting that it should be reduced because he does not earn enough to meet up with the stipulated sum.

The sum of both film contracts worth up to $9 million.</p><p>In the end, the court ruled out both Fraser’s request to reduce the alimony and Afton’s accusation of fraud.
