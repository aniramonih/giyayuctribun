They got engaged in May 2014 and married (<a href=#>at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport</a>) in August 2014. Cheryl and Robert just celebrated their first wedding anniversary. Cheryl is Robert’s third wife, and the man has a pretty tortured romantic history. For as long as they’ve been together, there were always rumors about Robert’s wandering eye. Just after they announced their engagement, <a href=#>the Enquirer did a big spread</a> (which I believed) about Robert fooling around with at least one married woman close to his home in Connecticut. And now Page Six says that Cheryl went into this marriage with her eyes wide open, which I guess means that she accepts that he has always fooled around and always will fool around?</p><p>Even close friends of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a notorious cheater who had numerous affairs while with past wives Emily Black and Mary Richardson, think his new wife, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star Cheryl Hines, was crazy to marry him and think he’d be faithful.</p><p>In Jerry Oppenheimer’s new book, “RFK Jr.: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Dark Side of the Dream,” out Sept. 22 from St. Martin’s Press, a decades-long friend of Kennedy and a guest at his August 2014 wedding “was mystified as to why Hines married Bob, since his history as a womanizer had become so public and was intertwined in scandal.”</p><p>“Any woman who gets involved with Bobby does so with her eyes open, or their brains lopped off,” said the so-called friend. “Any woman who thinks they’re going to change Bobby is misguided and purposefully ignorant. Women have to understand what they’re getting into when they’re with him.” The friend continued, “You can hate it, you can make excuses for it, you can do whatever you want to do, it doesn’t change the fact that he has a long history of doing certain things. And if you think, ‘Wow, I’ll be different,’ then you’re [bleep].”</p><p>RFK Jr.’s wild womanizing was chronicled in The Post last year when we exposed diaries he used to keep track of his affairs. But, writes Oppenheimer, Hines’ co-star Larry David told Kennedy, “Nothing you do will ever rattle her.”</p><p>Robert’s second wife, Mary, committed suicide by hanging in May 2012. Oppenheimer, whose book will be released by St. Martin’s on Sept. 22, talked to sources who said Mary was not surprised by Robert’s womanizing, but his romance with Cheryl shocked her.</p><p>“It was a shocker because Mary claimed she had introduced Hines to Bobby at a charity event, ­although Bobby and Hines asserted that ... Larry David had brought about the introduction,” says the book. “Still, Mary felt ‘very betrayed’ by what she termed the ‘Sisterhood’ ... women sticking ­together, women supporting one another.”</p><p>Just two months before Robert and Hines tied the knot, reports surfaced that he’d cheated on her with socialite Chelsea Chapman Kirwan.</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>First of all, this book sounds like a total hit job. To be fair though, it really doesn’t seem like Robert is being A) discreet or B) discriminating. He’ll sleep with anyone (allegedly). It’s almost like a compulsion. Which brings me to the larger point: why would any woman want that, especially with a dude who doesn’t really have any particular power? You know what I mean? I can understand the cachet of “being married to a Kennedy” when it’s a Kennedy with some power, some swag, some real authority. But RFK Jr is just an environmental activist with a famous name and a wandering eye. Is the Kennedy name still so powerful that it’s worth this price? As for Cheryl and the late Mary Kennedy’s issues with “the sisterhood”… I don’t know. I don’t think Cheryl was any better or any worse than all of the other women Robert has slept with over the years.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wenn21944128.jpg alt=wenn21944128 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWxjbIR2e8%2Banp6Xo57FoLrOmKannY%2Bgu7DD0piuobGPmLWmvtillqGhnprAoLnAq6minZSUxLC5wKegs52ilL%2Bnt76jqZhn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pati-dubroff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pati Dubroff">&larr;
