The proud mom even partially credits herself for helping get Charton and Culkin together. As she wrote in one Instagram <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>caption</a>, she previously convinced her daughter to stay in N.Y.C., which eventually led her to meeting Culkin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, she posted photos from a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>trip to her home city on Instagram</a>, including photos with family and friends and a snap of sweets that honored King Charles and his coronation.

But he didn't have a name for several weeks following his birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an appearance</a> on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> later that year, the HBO star explained why it took the pair so long to settle on a name for their son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My wife wanted Wolf. She was fighting hard for Wolf," Culkin shared. "We found [the name] in the hospital the day that he was born and we thought 'That's great.' But instead of pulling the trigger on it, [we thought], 'Let's torture ourselves for about seven weeks,' disagreeing with names before we come around to the name that we picked. 'Cause, we didn't know if we were having a boy or a girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He explained that they waited until right before Charton gave birth to brainstorm names. "So, she's in bed and we have a dry erase board so we can go over every name we thought of. And we were like 'Let's focus on girl names because we really like these,' " he recalled. "We narrowed it down to two girl names that we really liked, and we agreed it was going to be one of those two names if it's a girl and if it's a boy we're screwed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And we had a boy and spent seven weeks arguing about names," Culkin added with a laugh.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-didnt-always-want-kids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>They didn't always want kids</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jazz Charton Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Culkin has hinted that kids weren't always in the cards for the couple. In 2018, Culkin told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>iNews</a> that the couple were apprehensive about having kids: "It just seems like a lot to take on. I suppose if she gets pregnant, that would be fine but it's really not on our horizon."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor also noted that their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>cat Django</a>, named after jazz musician Django Reinhardt, was their first baby.

"She won't even travel because she doesn't want to leave him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Culkin seems glad that they did end up having kids.
