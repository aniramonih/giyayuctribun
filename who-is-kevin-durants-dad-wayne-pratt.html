Durant’s accomplishments in the NBA are legendary. The Brooklyn Nets player is a 12-time NBA All-Star and has also been named to the All-NBA First team on six occasions. He is also a two-time NBA champion, two-time NBA Finals MVP, and two-time NBA All-Star Game MVP.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Wayne Pratt’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name:&nbsp;</b>Wayne Pratt</li><li><b>Gender: Male</b></li><li><b>Ethnicity:&nbsp;</b>African American</li><li><b>Nationality:&nbsp;</b>American</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation:&nbsp;</b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion:&nbsp;</b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status:&nbsp;</b>Divorced</li><li><strong>Wayne Pratt</strong><b>’s Ex-Wife:&nbsp;</b>Wanda Durant</li><li><strong>Wayne Pratt</strong><b>’s </b><b>Children:&nbsp;</b>Four</li><li><b>Famous for:&nbsp;</b>Being Kevin Durant’s Father</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Kevin Durant’s Dad, Wayne Pratt?</strong></h2><p>Wayne Pratt is about 57 years old. While his exact date of birth is yet to be ascertained, credible reports have it that he was 22 years old when his famous son Kevin Durant was born. Now, it’s no secret that Durant is currently 35 years old as he was born on the 29th of September 1988. Based on that, one can conclude that his father is about 57 years old.</p><p>As it is with his age, much background information about Kevin Durant’s father is not available to the public. The reason for this is not far-fetched. Wayne was not someone who inspired any public interest until his son began making exploits in the NBA. Owing to this, details about his family background, childhood, upbringing, and his relatives remain unknown to the public.</p><p>Be that as it may, it is known that Wayne Pratt is a citizen of the United States of America. He hails from Washington D.C. and belongs to the African-American ethnic group. Wayne Pratt attended Potomac High School in Maryland and most likely completed his diploma. It is also likely that he may have pursued some further studies but there is no confirmation of this fact.</p><h2><strong>What Does Kevin Durant’s Dad do for a Living?</strong></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Durant's dad, Wayne Pratt, joins me tonight on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#SportsTalk</a> at 9pm to talk about his son being a champion & <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@teamdurantaau</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@ABC7News</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xo9aW6oSOe</a></p><p>— Erin Hawksworth (@ErinHawksworth) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 20, 2017</a></p><p>According to various reports, Kevin Durant’s father Wayne Pratt is a consultant and high school basketball coach. A 2016 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">report</a> about him indicated that he was working as the junior varsity boys coach at Friendship Collegiate Academy, a public high school called in Washington, D.C. It has also been reported in some quarters that he is a basketball coach at the St. James, a sports and wellness center located in Springfield, Virginia.</p><p>Wayne is not a basketball coach simply because he has a son who has dominated the NBA league for years. He has been conversant with the sport right from his early days and reportedly played high school basketball at Potomac High School in Maryland. He subsequently spent several years coaching various high school and youth teams and impacting the lives of young people.</p><p>Outside of basketball, Wayne Pratt had also made a living as a police officer. His career as an officer of the law began in October 1992. He went on to work as a police officer with MedStar Health in Washington D.C. Metro Area for over a decade. When he left MedStar Health in November 2022, he joined the U.S. Capital Police and served there for over 11 years. It was in November 2013 that he ceased being a police officer.</p><p>Going by the above, being the father of a famous and accomplished NBA star is not all that Wayne Pratt has going for him. He has lived a productive life and has meaningfully contributed to his society through his career choices as a youth basketball coach as well as a police officer.</p><h2><strong>When Did Kevin Durant’s Dad Leave him?</strong></h2><p>Kevin Durant’s father left him when he was about a year old. Wayne Pratt and Kevin Durant’s mom, Wanda Durant, previously got married and began building a family when they were young. Wayne Pratt was about 20 years old, and Wanda was about 19 years old when they had their first son, Anthony “Tony” Durant. Tony was born on the 6th of January 1986. Two years later, they welcomed their second child, Kevin, who was born in September 1988.</p><p>When Kevin was born, Wayne Pratt was 22 years old, while Wanda was 21 years old. Roughly a year later, Wayne Pratt abandoned Wanda with their two sons. They subsequently got divorced, and Wanda embraced the responsibility of being the sole provider for their two boys. She raised Tony and Kevin alone with the help of their grandmother, Barbara Davis.</p><p>Several years down the line, Wayne Pratt realized that it was a grave misjudgment to have abandoned his kids. He, however, believed that it was never too <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">late</a> to be a father to his sons and made efforts towards reintroducing himself into their lives. To get this done, Wayne Pratt committed himself to regain the goodwill of his ex-wife. It took him several years, but he was able to reconnect with his two sons, who were around 15 and 13 years old.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wayne Pratt: A letter to Kevin Durant. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#FathersDay</a>. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JsX0o5ULO1</a></p><p>— Andscape (@andscape) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 19, 2022</a></p><h3><strong>Does Kevin Durant have a Relationship with his Father?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Durant and his father Wayne Pratt have a great relationship. Although Wayne abandoned Kevin when he was an infant, he reintroduced himself into Kevin’s life when the boy was 13 and they were able to build a good relationship. After reentering his kid’s life, Wayne Pratt committed himself to be a good father and living up to the responsibilities that come with that.</p><p>Wayne was among the first to recognize Kevin’s talent. When he did, he began spurring and encouraging his son to work toward greatness. It is said that when the two-time NBA champ was still in high school, Wayne was fond of calling him “Green Room”. This was a reference to the NBA Draft Room where the top prospects for the year are kept on draft night and an example of how deeply Wayne believed in his son. Thankfully, his prediction came to pass as Kevin was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft as the second overall pick.</p><p>Since that draft pick in 2007 till date, Wayne Pratt has remained an important part of his son’s life and the media has come to hail him as a good example of a black father who maintained a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">presence</a> in his athlete son’s life. The former cop has also been quite forward about his past failings.</p><p>Wayne has openly acknowledged that it was wrong of him to have abandoned his sons. He attributed his actions to the fact that he was young and lacked an understanding of what it meant to be a father; which made things overwhelm him. All of these are now in the past though as he and his son now have a mutual understanding and respect for each other. On several occasions, Kevin Durant has acknowledged his father’s contribution to his success story.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>What is Wayne Pratt’s Age?</strong></h3><p>Wayne Pratt’s exact age is unknown, but he is believed to be about 57 years since it is said that he was 22 years old when his famous son was born.</p><h3><strong>What is Wayne Pratt’s Height?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Wayne Pratt’s height is listed at 6 feet 3 inches, which makes him about 8 inches shorter than his son, who is 6 feet 11 inches.</p><h3><strong>What is Wayne Pratt’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Wayne Pratt’s net worth is estimated to be around $1 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecqeraKmXZnCs63NrapmnJGZerit2KecZqiilsG1ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jazz-charton-kieran-culkin-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Kieran Culkin's Wife?
