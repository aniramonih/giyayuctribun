Rudy Gobert also does not seem to have a girlfriend at the moment. However, the French professional basketball player has been romantically linked to several popular women like Riley Reid and Hannah Stocking.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Rudy Gobert’s status as a famous and accomplished basketball player in the NBA has left many people curious about his life outside of the courts. Among other things, his many fans in the NBA community have been very inquisitive about his love life. While some wonder if he is married and who his wife is, others are preoccupied with figuring out if he is dating anyone.</p><h2><strong>Is Rudy Gobert Married?</strong></h2><p>Rudy Gobert is not married and does not have a wife. Also, he has never been married so he does not have an ex-wife as well. But over the years, people have been asking questions about his wife. The reason for this is not hard to see. Firstly, Rudy Gobert keeps his personal life private. So many people think of him as one of those famous personalities who might be married and keeping it away from the public. But from our gatherings, he is not secretly married.</p><p>Also, Rudy Gobert’s age and the height he has attained in his career are probably part of the reason why people think of him as a married man. Born on the 26th of June 1992, the basketball star has clearly attained the age of marriage. Considering that and the fact that he has built a successful career for himself, it becomes easy to see why some people mistake him for a married man.</p><p>In all, the NBA star is not married but nothing indicates he wouldn’t be doing so in the nearest future. Some reports have suggested that his parents’ failed marriage might have made him reluctant about getting married. But then, nothing shows this is true. Even though his parents divorced when he was only three years old, one can’t conclude it had any negative impact on Rudy’s perception of marriage. After all, both of his parents continued to be a part of his life after their divorce.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Rudy Gobert’s Girlfriend Now?</strong></h2><p>Rudy Gobert is not dating anyone now to the best of public knowledge. It is widely believed that he does not have a girlfriend. The notion that he is single is based on the fact that he has not been seen in public with anyone. Also, he has never talked about a romantic partner or shared any pictures with comments that would suggest he is in a relationship. Based on these facts, several platforms came to the conclusion that Rudy Gobert is not dating anyone.</p><p>But then, Rudy Gobert has always been a private person when it comes to his love life. So he might have a girlfriend but has gone to lengths to keep the relationship discreet and away from the glaring eyes of the media. The claim that he chooses to be single in other to focus on his career is also unfounded. The truth of the matter is that no one, except the people very close to him, knows his relationship status.</p><h2><strong>Is Rudy Gobert Gay?</strong></h2><p>Nothing suggests that the Minnesota Timberwolves center is gay. However, people began asking questions about his sexuality when they thought his teammate, Karl-Anthony Towns referred to him as “Rudy Gay”.</p><p>Towns was having an<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> interview</a> with ESPN’s sports journalist Malika Rose Andrews when he said: “Oh we signed Rudy Gay?”. He had mistaken Rudy Gobert who had just been signed by the Timberwolves for Rudy Gay who also plays in the NBA.</p><p>For some reason, people took this as a reference to Rudy Gobert’s sexuality and went about trying to find some answers. The fact that Gobert has always kept mum about this aspect of his life also didn’t help matters. Anyways, Rudy Gobert, as far as we can tell, is not gay. While he hasn’t been forthcoming with information about his love life, he has been romantically linked to some women in the past.</p><h2><strong>A Look at the Women Rudy Gobert Has Been Romantically Linked To&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Rudy Gobert has never bothered to comment on his love life, not to the media or on his social media handle. Because of this, it is often rumored that he is in a relationship anytime he is seen in public or in a gathering with a woman. None of these claims were ever confirmed but it is widely believed that Rudy Gobert has dated the likes of Riley Reid and Hannah Stocking.</p><h3><strong>Riley Reid and Rudy Gobert’s Relationship</strong></h3><p>Riley Reid is a famous American pornographic actress and one of the women romantically linked to Rudy Gobert in recent times. Born on the 9th of July 1991, the 32-year-old has been working in the adult film industry since 2010. She is one of the most accomplished performers in the industry as she was inducted into the XROC Hall of Fame in 2021.</p><p>Several months after Riley Reid got married to her husband Pavel Petkuns in June 2021, it started circulating in some quarters that she was dating Rudy Gobert. It was claimed that they met at a social event and began a relationship that they kept a secret. The pornographic actress was also said to have visited the NBA star several times but disguised herself to hide her identity. However, there is no shred of evidence that proves this is true.</p><h3><strong>Hannah Stocking and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Rudy Gobert</strong></h3><p>Hannah Stocking is the latest woman that has been romantically linked to Rudy Gobert. She is an American internet personality from Los Angeles, California, Hannah was born on the 4th of February 1992 and is currently 31 years old. The social media star is celebrated for her comedic YouTube videos and previously dated Klay Thompson who is also an NBA player.</p><p>It was first reported that Rudy Gobert and Hannah Stocking were dating in June 2021 after they were seen together in public. According to reports, Hannah and Rudy had fun spending time together in Utah while celebrating the latter’s birthday. However, neither of them confirmed that they were dating and some reports suggest they broke up in late 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmoqtdp8KlxYygppudoql6rq3Rq6CenF2ZvKa%2FjKGcZqCRq7JurYywoJ%2BdXaS%2FbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeff-cavaliere-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Cavaliere  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
