Although Love shares a happy life with his current spouse, the journey of his love life hasn't been easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's say he has seen it all, betrayal, heartbreak, and many more.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>All on Mike Love's Spouse & Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Mike has been married to his current spouse, with whom he shared two children. He married his spouse, Jacqueline Piesen, back in 1994, and they have been together ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>After being with someone for almost three decades now, it is safe to say that his marriage with Jacqueline is a success. However, this was his fifth shot at marriage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Yes, Mike has been married four times before, and this is his fifth marriage. He is a father of eight children.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mike was first married to his first wife, Francie St. Martin, in 1961, but the marriage lasted just two years, and they ended their relationship in 1963.&nbsp;</p><p>He eventually found love in his second wife, Suzanne Belcher, and tied the knot&nbsp;in 1965. However, this marriage was more than complicated.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Mike Love with His Spouse</strong> (Source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>During their divorce proceedings, it was revealed that the separation resulted from an <a href=# rel="follow noopener">affair</a> between his wife and his cousin, Dennis.</p><p>Mike then married his third spouse, Tamara Fitch, in 1971. This marriage lasted for six years, and they eventually divorced in 1977.&nbsp;</p><p>Then came his fourth marriage, which lasted from 1981 to 1984.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He had a total of six kids from his four marriages.</p><p>His kids' names are Shawn Marie Love, Ambha Love, Brian Edward Alan Love, Hayleigh Love, Summer Love, Melinda Love, Christian Love, and Teresa Love.</p><p>Mike now lives a very happy life along with his current spouse and children.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Surely Mike did have his share of issues in his marriage, but the best part of it all was that he never stopped searching for true love, and eventually, he found it in his current wife, Piesen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More on:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Rod Taylor's Daughter Continues His Legacy</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2>A Happy Life&nbsp;</h2><p>Mike Love now shares moments and memories of his happy life with his social media followers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He often takes to his social media to share beautiful moments with his wife and expresses his love for her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>For example, on the occasion of Valentine's day this year (2022), he took to his Instagram account to share a very sweet and beautiful picture with his wife and wrote,&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Valentine's Day to you and yours! Make LOVE the center of your life today and every day.</p><p>There really is no age for romance. Mike feels lucky to have his wife in his life and is hesitant to flaunt his love for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This adorable couple has lasted a long time now, and their love and romance are still as fresh as new.</p><p>We wish for these to be united as they are for years to come and hope they get to share more love and light with each other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqagpJ1doby3sYysp6ito5p6pLTIpZurnZ5jtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mike-palacio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Palacio">&larr;
