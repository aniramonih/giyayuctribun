They are devastated after hearing the news of his death. In this post, you will get all the information related to her death.</p><h2>When Did Ben Pollack Die?</h2><p>Ben Pollack was born on May 28, 1992 in San Diego, California and <strong>passed away unexpectedly of natural causes in his home near Denver, Colorado on December 14, 2023. </strong>His cause of death is not yet disclosed.</p><p>He is the son of Janet & Larry, brother of Rachel Poleke and grandson of Judy Pollack, Bud & Jane Romberg. The community mourned the loss of a talented and dedicated teacher. His death has left a void that cannot be filled. The outpouring of sincere tributes to Ben Pollack ensures that his memory will endure.</p><p>After his death, Erik Van Heyningen shared a post on Facebook and wrote, “Ben Pollack is gone. I’ll miss you. Rest easy, Ben.”</p><p><strong>If you want to know which other persons’ died recently then you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><h2><strong>A Look at Ben’s Multi-Faceted Achievements</strong></h2><p><strong>Ben spent his formative years living in Poway, California.</strong> He was in the school and synagogue bands and choruses from an early age, demonstrating a natural gift for music. While a junior at Poway High School, he joined the school’s award-winning Die Lieders ensemble, began performing in musicals and founded a barbershop quartet.</p><p>Because he loved playing the euphonium, he was named first chair in the Wind Symphony. Ben was able to attain the Eagle Scout rank with a combination of athletics, martial arts and extensive volunteer work. Ben attended the University of Colorado, Boulder on a full out-of-state tuition scholarship and graduated with a Bachelor of Music Education and a teaching certificate.</p><p>Ben worked as a choral music teacher at Colorado Springs’ Carmel Middle School after graduating in 2014. The following year, he was employed by the Huerfano RE-1 School District to establish a music program in Walsenburg, CO.</p><p>After his death Huerfano Re-1 Music Department, shared a post on Facebook and wrote, “It is with great sadness that we share the news of our former band teacher, Ben Pollack passing today. We don’t know any details.”</p><p>Beginning his career as a music educator with students in grades kindergarten through twelve, he eventually zeroed down on the band and choir programs at John Mall High School. He held in high regard the 2019 Outstanding Young Educator award from the Colorado Music Education Association.</p><p>In addition to his role as choir director, he mentored pupils and helped them win numerous awards. Ben made great efforts to ensure that the kids had opportunities to perform outside of Walsenburg at statewide events such as the UNC/Greeley Jazz Festival in Greeley, Colorado with the district’s Spanish Peaks Jazz Band.</p><p>Ben just completed his Master of Music Education at the esteemed Jacobs School of Music at the University of Indiana, Bloomington, where he lived for two years. Professor Demondrae Thurman was an incredible resource for him while he studied the euphonium and music instruction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ben-Pollack-Obituary-1-1.jpg><p>In his practicum, he looked at vocal and instrumental pedagogy side by side with the goal of becoming better musicians via exposure to both. Ben was described by Professor Thurman as an absolutely great pupil.</p><p>His optimism and eagerness to learn were infectious. He began a new position in July of 2023 as an instrumental music teacher at Parker, Colorado’s Ponderosa High School. In their inaugural tournament together last fall, he guided his tiny but formidable group to a third-place result.</p><p>He was able to continue his conducting career and share his love of music with future generations by directing the Sounds of Indiana barbershop chorus when he was in Bloomington.</p><p>Ben loved to play disc golf with his pals, crack jokes and drink craft beer when he wasn’t devoted to his students and work. Ben had a profound impact on everyone he met in his brief life and his family has received several letters and poems praising his enthusiasm, originality and resilience.</p><p>We shall miss him terribly because of how much we love him. His absence will be deeply felt. Our condolences are with his family and friends.
