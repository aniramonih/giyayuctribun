Instead, he just went on with his life without saying anything to anyone."</p><p>Days after she was last seen, Jorgensen was spotted entering her apartment with her keys 28 times.</p><p>On April 28, he allegedly left while carrying two duffle bags and a suitcase to his truck.</p><p><a href=#>Google</a> data obtained by police show that he searched terms like "jugular" and "what do police do with a missing person's report."</p><p>He also searched "lime for soil" which is used to speed up body decomposition.</p><p>Police arrested Jorgenson on Monday after finding a&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a>&nbsp;post from April 5 in which he allegedly threatened Starren.</p><p>“N u owe me 2 bc u called the cops on me 2 times. Very clear I was of that being punishable by hanging. I’m giving u this plea bargain opportunity," he allegedly wrote.</p><p>Police said Jorgenson barricaded himself inside his apartment when the SWAT team came for him. He allegedly started a fire and tried to fight off officers.</p><h2>CHILLING SIGNS</h2><p>Starren, a mother-of-three, struggled with <a href=#>drug</a> addiction and <a href=#>mental health</a> issues, her father told police, according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Law & Crime</a>.</p><p>She was supposed to go to a drug treatment center before she disappeared but she never went.</p><p>Starren's father said she seemed afraid of a boyfriend named Joe, who wrapped a rope around her neck when "things got out of hand" one time, according to <a href=#>court</a> docs.</p><p>Neighbors said they saw her with red marks and bruises on her face and offered to call the police, but Starren reportedly said: "It will just make things worse."</p><p>According to the court docs, police found evidence of someone "seriously injured or killed" and what seemed to be an attempt by someone "to clean up the blood" in Starren's apartment.</p><p>The blood was found strewn across the living room and kitchen near a cracked TV screen and broken glass from a microwave.</p><h2>SUSPECT CHARGED</h2><p>Authorities found a storage facility using Jorgenson's phone data earlier this week. Investigators discovered someone had rented the unit with his roommate's name.</p><p>Outside of the storage unit, police smelled a strong odor consistent with decomposing flesh, the outlet reports.</p><p>Investigators found a green tote bag with cleaning supplies, a large cooler wrapped in plastic, a blue duffle bag, and a small carry-on suitcase.</p><p>“A torso appeared to be in the large cooler pulled from the unit,” the complaint said.</p><p>“The arms and legs appeared to be in the large bag, and a head was in the smaller cooler removed from the unit."</p><p>Starren's death has been ruled a homicide but her cause of death is still under investigation.</p><p>Jorgenson is charged with second-degree murder, as well as separate charges of arson, threats of violence, and disarming an officer from his resisted arrest.</p><p>He's being held on a $5million bond and is due back in court on August 21.</p><p>Starren has been described as a devoted mother in a <a href=# aria-label="GoFundMe (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe</a> page that was started to raise money for her family.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Her beautiful three kids have horrifically lost the most beautiful person in their lives," the description reads.</p><p>"I don't have many ways to help them myself so my hopes are we are able to help them this way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdoan93fphwZqOno5q9qXnJqKmgnZ6ovK95wqGgpaSZo7Russ6oq5qflWK6orrIo5yhZaOprrO%2BxKdkpKGcobKlew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./us-comedian-chris-delia-accused-of-sexual-harassment-abuse-and-assault-by-multiple-women-three-years-after-he-was-hit-by-sexual-misconduct-allegations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris D'Elia Accused of Sexual Misconduct Allegations">&larr;
