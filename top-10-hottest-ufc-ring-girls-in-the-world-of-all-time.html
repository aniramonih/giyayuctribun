So here it is, the Top 15 Most Beautiful UFC Ring Girls of All Time. There is not a shadow of a doubt over the amount of brutality that exists in one of the most popular promotions in MMA, the UFC.</p><p>Even if you have been a hardcore MMA fan, it is not always a pleasing sight to see that some of the toughest fighters on the Earth would go head to head in a sport that draws a lot of resemblance to a street fight, where most of the bouts would result in bruised, battered, and bloodied sceneries.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-red-dela-cruz>10. Red Dela Cruz</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-153.png><p>One of the 10 Hottest UFC Ring Girls is Red Dela Cruz, that came to the stardom after that she was raised up in the Philippines in not a very idyllic life conditions.</p><p>Yet even back then, she aspired to become a model and she has been blessed with all the merits of good looking appearance, brains, and charisma.</p><p>Therefore it was no wonder to see her winning the UFC Octagon Girl Search in Asia several years ago, as she even went on to become one of the most famous UFC ring girls ever, in the blink of an eye.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-logan-stanton>9. Logan Stanton</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-152.png><p>Logan Stanton was a UFC ring girl for a short period of time and she went on to find success in the modelling industry and that is the reason why just old school fans might remember her.</p><p>Yet, she utterly deserves to take a position in our list of the 15 Hottest UFC Ring Girls, in the light of the fact that she was once heralded as “the cutest Octagon Girl” ever observed in Dana White’s company.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-amber-nichole-miller>8. Amber Nichole Miller</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-151.png><p>Amber Nichole Miller was among the first UFC ring girl ever and even if there has been a long time that she is not working as a UFC ring girl, she could not be excluded from the 15 Hottest UFC Ring Girls.</p><p>While she left the UFC over a decade ago, she connected with the promotion as she married the legendary former UFC light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz, who has been considered as one of The most overrated UFC fighters of all time.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-jhenny-andrade>7. Jhenny Andrade</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-150.png><p>Jhenny Andrade is a Brasilian model that has been working in the UFC for some time and was honoured to win the Best Ring Girl Of The World award three times for her unbelievable beauty and sexy body forms.</p><p>It seems that as time goes by, she is becoming even more alluring, while in her social media profiles, she has racked up more than half a million followers.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-luciana-andrade>6. Luciana Andrade</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-149.png><p>Luciana Andrade is a gorgeous woman in any sense of the words to the point that she is assumed to be among the most beautiful women in the world, let alone among UFC ring girls.</p><p>Moreover, the Brasilian model is not perfect just in her looks, in as much as her brains are as great as her appearance in that she is an educated legal practitioner with the body shape similar to an angel and an enlightening charming face.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-natasha-wicks>5. Natasha Wicks</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-148.png><p>One of the 10 Hottest UFC Ring Girls who was also a fan favourite is Natasha Wicks, that is similar to more of a rockstar with an insane attitude and a dashing style, perhaps because she lives in Las Vegas.</p><p>She is excellent at playing seductive games with her flashy hairstyles and stunning body type. While she is no longer working in the UFC, as soon as she quit her job as a UFC ring girl, she entered the modelling industry and it seems that she is a successful model too.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-ali-sonoma>4. Ali Sonoma</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-147.png><p>Ali Sonoma is a Florida native who was previously a UFC ring girl, and still with considering her long legs, her tall height as well as her unfathomable blue eyes she would take a spot in our list of the 15 Hottest UFC Girls.</p><p>She stopped working in the UFC when she found a new passion for a modelling profession outside the octagon as she proved to gain great success as well.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-summer-daniels>3. Summer Daniels</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-146.png><p>One of the other UFC’s top 10 hottest ring girls is Summer Daniels who tended to create unforgettable moments in the cage in the light of her outgoing and energetic character as well as her stunning and refreshing look.</p><p>While she had done spans of her career as both UFC and Bellator ring girl, showing MMA fans her enchanting beauty, she is one of few girls that has worked for these two rival organisations</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-carly-baker>2. Carly Baker</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-145.png><p>While she often features on TV for the promotion, her successful career has led her to gain a big number of social media followers, especially when she takes huge delight in a variety of hobbies like pilates, Muay Thai and dancing as she amazingly practices martial arts too.</p><p>It is quite fascinating that she tends to share her activities of singing, dancing, modelling, and fitness, on her social media accounts, and perhaps that is why she receives so much support.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-brittney-palmer>1. Brittney Palmer</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportsunfold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-144.png><p>Ever since then she is still working as a UFC ring girl, being proved to be one of the UFC’s top 10 hottest ring girls in the light of the fact that not only she has a charming beauty but also she is a kind of a woman whose path, determination and lust for life are uniquely unparalleled.</p><p>You would also agree with us if you had known that she has such a resiliency that has overcome the most painful moments of her life and came back to life</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usrZ6bvK2wjZympmekpL1ufY9mn6ispJrAtXnUn5pmqpmjtG6zyKujrGWZo3q1tMRmrqiqnJl6sLKMmqOlZaSeuqZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tyrese-haliburton-net-worth-endorsement-salary-wingspan-rings-and-more-top-five-things-you-did-not-know-about.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyrese Haliburton  Net Worth, Endorsement, Salary, Wingspan, Rings and More  Top Five Things Y">&larr;
