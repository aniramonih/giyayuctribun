It was a year that he took part in a robbery, and one man lost his soul. His actions alone locked him out of freedom door. Since Curtis had in mind that he has done a crime, he gave authorities a time to take coffee by turning himself in. He was locked behind bars.

He grew up in a generation that children had to look after themselves and find support from the streets. He was natured by lack of all three basic needs, and as a result, had to find means to survive.
