Years later, the actress revealed that she wished to give motherhood another go because of how she'd messed up with her only son, Richie.</p><p class=Zg>In 1969, Mary Tyler Moore was 33 years old when she had a miscarriage. During a Larry King show appearance, the television personality explained how that loss became a silver lining as it saved her life.</p><p class=Zg>While Moore was dealing with the tragic loss, she was required to have routine blood tests. That's when "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" host found out about her type I diabetes diagnosis.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Mary Tyler Moore on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" as Mary Richards on June 30, 1970, and her with Dick Van Dyke as Rob Petrie, on The Dick Van Dyke Show" on September 25, 1963. | Source: CBS/Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Normal blood sugar levels are usually between 70 and 110; Moore's was <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ustimetoday.com/mary-tyler-moore-miscarried-at-the-age-of-33/>a shocking 750</a>! Her doctors were quite surprised at how she functioned well with such high blood sugar levels.</p><p class=Zg>They immediately got her to start taking insulin injections to remedy the medical condition. However, this was difficult for the actress as people still didn't know much about diabetes.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>MARY'S MARRIAGES AND WISH TO BE A MOTHER AGAIN</strong></p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore at a party at Chasen's nightclub in Hollywood, California, in 1971. | Source: Frank Edwards/Fotos International/Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Moore met and fell in love with Grant A.

With her first husband, the television personality had one child, son Richie Meeker, at age 18.</p><p class=Zg>Moore and Tinker quickly got married in 1962.

She later realized that she was pounding her fists on the carpeted floor while having a tantrum she was never allowed to express as a child.</p><p class=Zg>Moore wasn't the only one struggling with life as Richie had spiraled into drug use in high school in Fresno, California. In February 1973, the star's son called her while sobbing frantically, asking for safety from a cocaine dealer.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Mary Tyler Moore in rehearsal for "The Dick Van Dyke Show" on December 2, 1963, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Earl Theisen/Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Richie was being threatened with death over unpaid debts, and that's when Moore realized how deep her son was in drug usage. She found a doctor for him and offered Richie shelter on the condition that he visit the specialist.</p><p class=Zg>Over the next two years, the actress's son managed to get clean and finish high school. In 1979, Moore and Tinker started discussing how they'd become distant, but these feeble attempts were only made when she star was drinking.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Mary Tyler Moore posing for a photo, circa 1965. | Source: NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>The distance between her and her husband was so bad that Moore had her first affair.

Besides the affair, in 1979, Moore made a revelation about motherhood to Barbara Walters a year before losing Richie, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thelist.com/39449/stunning-transformation-mary-tyler-moore/>stating</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I often wish that now, the situation were such that I could have another stab at motherhood.

The television personality shared how she had been too eager to start a life on her own in her teenage years.</p><p class=Zg>She also said she wanted to prove herself worthy of someone's attention; however, by 1995, Moore had come to terms with not being given another chance to become a mother. She explained that she'd gotten to where she didn't think her goal was important anymore.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>LOSING HER ONLY SON, RICHIE</strong></p><p class=Zg>On October 15, 1980, "The Dick Van Dyke Show" star received a call from Tinker, her then–estranged husband and CBS executive, informing her <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/mary-tyler-moore-recalled-sons-accidental-death-at-24-in-memoir-w463205/>Richie was dead</a>. At age 24, Moore's son had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p class=Zg>It was later revealed that Richie's death was an accident.

In her book, she recalled how high and clear the water had been as she knelt over and opened the urn to empty the ashes, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/mary-tyler-moore-recalled-sons-accidental-death-at-24-in-memoir-w463205/>saying</a>:</p><p class=Zg>“What was meant to be a prayer became an outraged demand. ‘You take care of him,’ I screamed at the sky.”</p><p class=Zg>The television personality and Tinker eventually divorced the year after Richie's death.

In a 1995 CBS interview, the iconic star noted how her stardom had come at a price.</p><p class=Zg>The busier she got, the less time she spent with her son until he grew distant. However, they did become a bit closer when he was an adult, and Richie's life appeared to be on track until his accidental death.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Richard G.
