Well, that is exactly what has happened to the famed comedic actor, Will Forte. Forte is teaming up with former President Barack Obama for a new scripted series. This new series has a working title of <a href=#>Bodkin </a>and sees a podcaster unraveling some dark secrets as he looks for his next story. This will be Barack and Michelle Obama’s first crack at their own <a href=#>produced show</a> on Netflix.</p><p>You are probably wondering how this even came to be, and that was honestly us too. Barack and Michelle Obama had overseen several unscripted shows on the streaming platform, and now they are moving forward with their own show. Bodkin is being produced by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, <a href=#>Higher Ground</a>, and their independent studio, wiip. Joining Will Forte in this new dark comedic thriller series are Siobhan Cullen, Robyn Cara, David Wilmot, and Chris Walley. The Obamas will be serving as executive producers Tonya Davis, David Flynn, and Paul Lee. It was created by Jez Scharf and will be run by Sharf and Alex Metcalf.</p><p>Bodkin follows Gilbert (Will Forte) and a group of podcasters who start to investigate the disappearance of three people in a coastal Irish town. When they begin to uncover the truth about the disappearances, things begin to get dicey. Gilbert is an American podcaster, whose family had emigrated from Cork, but had originally been from Chicago. He has likely traveled back to Ireland to get in touch with his ancestry there, only he finds more trouble than he had bargained for. He is joined by Dove and Emmy, who are two gung-ho podcasters that get roped into the trouble right alongside Gilbert.</p><p>It’s quite interesting that The Obamas have gone from their political background right into creating entertaining content. That is quite a leap, and we are honestly excited to see where this new series goes. Netflix has clearly thought enough of the work that the pair had done previously and is trusting them to deliver on this new show. Higher Ground had previously worked on American Factory, which won an Academy Award, Crip Camp, which was nominated for an Academy Award, and Fatherhood, the hit drama that starred Kevin Hart. Will Forte is clearly in some great company, as all the three films listed have been hits among audiences. Forte is a busy man and so far, there is no timetable on when Bodkin is going to be released.</p><p>Will Forte is currently working on <a href=#>MacGruber 2</a>, Strays, <a href=#>Wile E. Coyote</a>, and Expiration Date, which is a mini-series. With so many films and television series on the way, it might be some time before we see Bodkin come out. The casting announcements have already happened, along with the production crew, which means that production should get underway soon. Should production start sometime in the next couple of months, we might be seeing Bodkin by mid-2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ivmaG5brLOq6ueZZKWv6Kvymamm5mdlnq0sdGinKxmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-smith-also-boycotted-the-1989-grammy-awards-find-out-why-w162515.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Smith Also Boycotted the 1989 Grammy Awards: Find Out Why">&larr;
