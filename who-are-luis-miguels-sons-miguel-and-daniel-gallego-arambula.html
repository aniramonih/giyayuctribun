He had them with his former partner, Aracely Arambula. Luis Miguel’s first son, Miguel, was born on January 1, 2007, and Daniel was born on December 18, 2008. Their relationship with their father has been strained, and it’s unknown if Luis has resumed contact with them.</strong></p><p>It would appear that El Sol de Mexico has a history of child abandonment, as could be seen in his relationship with his first child and daughter, Michelle Salas. Remarkably, the story of Miguel and his brother, Daniel, is not part of the Netflix series, Luis Miguel: The Series, a decision taken by their mother to protect their privacy.</p><p>However, that omission has led to even more questions regarding what the sons of The Sun of Mexico are up to. Here’s all you need to know about Miguel and Daniel Gallego Arambula.</p><h2><strong>Miguel Gallego Arambula Is Luis Miguel’s Oldest Son</strong></h2><p>Miguel, Luis Miguel’s oldest son, is now a teenager who is currently 16 years old. His parents named him Miguel Gallego Arambula at the time of his birth on January 1, 2007. Miguel was most likely born in Beverly Hills, California, United States of America, because his father, Luis Miguel, lived there with his mother at the time.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Miguel Gallego Arambula’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Miguel Gallego Arambula</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> January 1, 2007</li><li><b>Miguel Gallego Arambula’s Age: </b>16 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Latin-American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Mexican/American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Capricorn</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Miguel Gallego Arambula’s Parents:</strong> Luis Miguel Gallegos Basteri (Father), Aracely Arambula (Mother)</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Daniel Gallego Arambula (Brother), Michelle Salas (Half-sister)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the son of famous Mexican singer Luis Miguel with his ex, Aracely Arambula</li></ul><p>Miguel Gallego Arambula holds multiple citizenship statuses at the moment. His status as an American citizen comes primarily from the fact that he was born in the United States, while his Mexican citizenship status is down to his parents’ nationality. Miguel belongs to the Latin-American ethnic group.</p><p>Not much is known about Miguel besides that he is the celebrity kid of popular Mexican musician Luis Miguel. The Sun of Mexico was not married to Miguel’s mother or anyone else at the time of his oldest son’s birth.</p><p>They, however, lived in the same house, and for the first two years of his life, Miguel felt the constant presence of his father. All that changed when his parents separated in 2009, and his mother became his primary caregiver.</p><h2><strong>Daniel Gallego Arambula Is the Youngest of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Luis Miguel’s Sons With Aracely Arambula</strong></h2><p>El Sol de Mexico fathered another son almost two years after Miguel’s birth. His name is Daniel Gallego Arambula. Daniel was also born in Beverly Hills, California, the United States of America, on December 18, 2008, just before his older brother, Miguel’s 2nd birthday. Like his older brother, Miguel, Daniel is also a citizen of Mexico and the United States of America and Latin American ethnicity.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Daniel Gallego Arambula’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Daniel Gallego Arambula</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> December 18, 2008</li><li><b>Daniel Gallego Arambula’s Age: </b>15 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Latin-American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Mexican/American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Sagittarius</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Daniel Gallego Arambula’s Parents:</strong> Luis Miguel Gallegos Basteri (Father), Aracely Arambula (Mother)</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Miguel Gallego Arambula (Brother), Michelle Salas (Half-sister)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the son of famous Mexican singer Luis Miguel with his ex, Aracely Arambula</li></ul><p>Daniel’s mother took a lot of precautions to shield Daniel and his brother, Miguel, from public and media scrutiny after she split up with their father shortly after Daniel was born. For emphasis, Daniel’s parents separated in 2009, which meant that he didn’t get as much time as his brother did with their parents.</p><p>The trajectory of Daniel’s life seems to be heading in the same direction as those of his parents, who are both musically inclined. Many have come to this conclusion after his mother uncharacteristically posted a short clip of Daniel singing a song by Justin Timberlake.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Daniel’s mother had a hand in the leaked video, but it does not detract from the fact that the video received positive feedback from family members and the general public.</p><h2><strong>The Mother Of Luis Miguel’s Sons Is Also A Mexican Singer</strong></h2><p>The woman responsible for bringing Miguel and Daniel Gallego Arambula into this world is a Mexican singer known as Aracely Arambula. And aside from being a singer, Luis Miguel’s baby mama is also an actress. The singer cum actress was born Aracely Arambula Jacques on March 6, 1975, in Chihuahua City, Mexico, to Mexican couple Manuel Arambula and Socorro Jacques.</p><p>She also has an older brother named Leonardo Arambula.&nbsp;Aracely Arambula is regarded as Luis Miguel’s eternal love, and for a while, it appeared that those assumptions were unequivocally true. Aracely Arambula and El Sol de Mexico began dating in 2005, and it was a relationship filled with the bliss and passion characteristic of people of Latin persuasion.</p><p>Initially, Luis Miguel made it clear that he wanted children with Aracely, and they both set out to make it happen. After the anxiety that followed several failed attempts to get pregnant, Aracely eventually became pregnant and had two sons within the space of almost two years between January 2007 and December 2008. Despite the fiery passion and love, it might surprise many that Miguel and Daniel’s parents never got married.</p><p>And so, after four blissful and fun-filled years as a family of four, the relationship which began in 2005 ended in 2009, shortly after the birth of their second son. Aracely was left to pick up the pieces and became the primary caregiver of their two sons, Miguel and Daniel.</p><h3><strong>Luis Miguel’s Sons Do Not Share A Relationship With Their Father</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of this article, it was emphasized that Luis Miguel might have a pretty unsavory knack for abandoning his children whenever he feels like it.</p><p>To clarify this, one would have to look no farther than the musician’s relationship with his oldest child and daughter, Michelle Salas.&nbsp;The singer abandoned Michelle when she was only six years old and only acknowledged her after the model had called out her father on his poor behavior towards her.</p><p>In the case of Miguel and his brother, Daniel, The Sun of Mexico left their care and nurturing entirely up to their mother. Certain sources claim that the singer was intermittently involved in his sons’ lives. However, that involvement is limited to finances, and passive would be the accurate description of his involvement.</p><p>As recently as 2021, the supposed financial involvements were explicitly called into question after the boys’ mother claimed that Luis had not sent child support funds for over a year.&nbsp;Aracely Arambula’s lawyer backed up this statement, and when contacted for comments on the subject, Luis Miguel’s camp claimed that there were no funds at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yaqZ5lnKq2tHnMop6unZyoerS7zaxkpqGXqrKtecCnm2ackaO2priMoJilpJWcvG6t0Zqkm62clnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tom-segura-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Tom Seguara's Parents?
