However, her take on it is quite enlightening.</p><p class=dh>Karyn Parsons grew up as a biracial kid in the '70s and '80s, a time when racism still thrived. Her father, Kenneth B. Parsons, was a white Welsh man, and her mother, Louise Hubert, an African-American.</p><p class=dh>Parsons grew up learning about her black heritage from her mother, and all her life, she has been aware of it. As an adult, she married a White man, movie producer, Alexandre Rockwell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/59b5a5b568abb0ad079021b489af02fe1986141577614948.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Karyn Parsons attends the Ubuntu Education Fund's 16th Annual "1 Million to One: Changing The Odds" Gala at Gotham Hall on June 11, 2015 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE</strong></p><p class=dh>The union made Karyn Parsons kids — Lana and Nico — biracial, and the actress found herself raising children with a mixed heritage. However, the actress does not see her children as two parts of a whole.</p><p class=dh>The way she sees it, what makes a person is not the race they identify with, but the character of their personality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0c56b073aeb5a5052e34b3715fad6ecd521911577615153.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Alexandre Rockwell, his wife Karyn Parsons and their children Lana and Nico Rockwell at Auditorium Parco Della Musica on November 9, 2013 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>"You know, if you have kids, you see them come into the world with different personalities, very distinct personalities [because] everyone is different."</p><p class=dh>The "The Job" star added that she ensures her children understand their uniqueness. She educates them to love who they are and respect other people.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PEOPLE WILL SEE WHAT THEY WANT</strong></p><p class=dh>Parsons emphasizes on Lana and Nico <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/actress-karyn-p/>knowing the history of the</a> Black people, and that of other races. She maintains that she does not teach her children to live a biracial lifestyle.</p><p class=dh>The actress also does not believe that being biracial means one has to identify with a specific group as everyone is human and has a story. For her, it's more important to have self-love as people will always see what they want.</p><p class=dh>As a child, Parsons faced racism, but because her skin was lighter than most blacks, it wasn't as bad as those she grew up with. The experience taught her that small-minded people would never see beyond what they have in front of them.</p><p class=dh>Interestingly, despite the actress's beliefs and views, she identifies more with the Black community. She uses her charities and production house, Sweet Blackberry, to tell the stories of people who contributed to the African-American community to kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5ec74f13beebfd8ea3aba42d6ff0049d1342671577615233.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Karyn Parsons attends Wizard World Comic Con Fan Fest Chicago on March 7, 2015 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHE FOUND A SECOND LOVE AND DITCHED THE FIRST</strong></p><p class=dh>The "Missing Nia" star has produced two animated films to that effect and published a children's book, "How High the Moon."

Feeling discouraged, a friend advised her to study writing with the author, Jim Kusock.</p><p class=dh>The actress turned writer discovered that she loved creating stories more than being in front of the camera, and switched careers. Karyn Parsons today is a published author living her dream.</p><p class=dh>The California native might have switched careers, but she owes her marriage to being an actress. She met her husband on the set of the 2002 movie, "13 Moons" and they got married the next year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c49c0a63a929926426c2899b4e2977291244891577615574.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Alexandre Rockwell attends "In The Soup" during the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival on April 24, 2018 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MORE THAN SKIN</strong></p><p class=dh>While Parsons identifies more as a writer, and her husband is behind the scenes, their children already have movie credits to their names. Lana and Nico both starred in the 2013 production, "Little Feet."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ea5a5cbf5cb017493bb860b9e0bf6e641261591577615040.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Karyn Parsons visits SiriusXM Studios on June 1, 2017 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The actress also started young, with her role as "Hilary Banks" on Fresh Prince, making her a TV sensation alongside Will Smith, Tatyana Ali, and Alfonso Ribeiro. The series had an all-black cast, and by the time it ended in '96, it was the most popular "Black-centered" show on TV.</p><p class=dh>Parson never let her race define who she was. The Los Angeles-born celebrity saw the world with a different lens while carving a niche for herself, and she's teaching her children to look beyond "Skin" in their journey through life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpvcHFjbHqsrdGypWaokafAsLrSZp%2Beql2eu7Wx0auYnKGRoXqurdGroJqflWK%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kelis-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelis Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
