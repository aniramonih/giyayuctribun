Marcus currently has retired from football and works as an analyst at CBS TV.</p><p>Maybe you know about Marcus Allen very well But do you know how old and tall is he, and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Marcus Allen’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Marcus Allen was born on 26 March 1960 in California. He is one of the three children born to Harold & Gwendolyn Allen. His elder brother, Damon Allen is also a former footballer & elder sister, Michelle Allen is an actress. Initially, Marcus used to play football at Abraham Lincoln High School; then from 1978 to 1981, he played at the University of Southern California. As he joined this university in 1978, he became a member of the Trojans’ National Championship team (as a backup).</p><p>In 1979, he moved to fullback & finally, in 1980, he was the starter at tailback. In the same year, he became the third-most player in the nation to rush for 1,563 yards. After rushing for 2,342 yards in 1981, he became the second player in NCAA history to rush over 2,000 yards in one season. In his total college seasons, Marcus managed a total of 46 touchdowns & 4,664 rushing yards.</p><p>In 1986, Marcus Allen married Kathryn Edwards & in 2001, the couple got divorced due to an alleged extramarital affair on Marcus’ part.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 26 March 1960, Marcus Allen is 64 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.88 m tall, and his weight is 95&nbsp;kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>‘Los Angeles Raiders’ selected Marcus Allen in the 10th overall selection of the 1982 NFL Draft. He led the ‘Raiders’ to their best score by rushing 697 yards in the AFC at 8-1. In Super Bowl XVIII on 22 Jan 1984, in which the ‘Raiders’ won over ‘Washington Redskins’ by 38–9, Marcus played fantastically well by running for 191 yards, catching two passes from 18 yards and scoring two touchdowns. Encouraged by continuous wins, Marcus then joined a small group of players & won both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP. Known for his gracious nature & team spirit, Marcus was commended by everyone.</p><p>However, soon due to some contract disputes, his relationship with Al Davis (owner of Marcus’ team: ‘Raiders’) soured. This dispute further worsened when a taped interview of Marcus was broadcasted in which he alleged Davis of trying to ruin his future. Due to increasing disparities, Marcus finally left ‘Los Angeles Raiders’ and joined the ‘Kansas City Chiefs’ in 1993. He continued to perform well with the ‘Chiefs’ too and hence, was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association. Marcus finally retired after the 1997 season & in 2008, he joined as a spokesperson of the sports website OPENSports.com.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>●Heisman trophy:1981<br>●Maxwell award:1981<br>●Walter Camp award:1981<br>●NFL Honors – AP Offensive Rookie of the Year:1982<br>●Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award:1985<br>●AP Most Valuable player:1985</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Marcus Allen in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Marcus-Allen-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Marcus Allen’s total net worth is $5 million.
