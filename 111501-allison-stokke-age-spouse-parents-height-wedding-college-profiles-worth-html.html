Whereas David took the path of a Gymnast, Allison veered towards pole-vaulting, where she proceeded to break numerous records.</p><p class=align-left>What ethnicity is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Allison Stokke</a>? This Caucasian girl attended Newport Harbour High School before earning herself an athletic scholarship to the University of California, majoring in Sociology. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Allison Stokke's</a> college team was the <i>California Golden Bears</i>, where she carried on her <a href=#>record-breaking</a> streak.</p><h3>Allison Stokke's records and achievements</h3><ul><li><strong>2004</strong>: <i>US Championship</i> record (15/16) scaling 3.86m.</li><li><strong>2005:</strong> the record of scaling 4.11m</li><li><strong>2006:</strong> <i>California State Champion </i>with the record of scaling 4.14m</li><li><strong>2007:</strong> broke her previous record by scaling 4.21 m</li><li><strong>2011</strong>: <i>All-American</i> status after earning 8th at the<i> NCAA Indoor Championships</i></li><li><strong>2012:</strong> final and lifetime record is 4.36m</li></ul><p class=align-left>The last time Stokke broke a record, in 2012, was during an attempt to be selected for the US Olympic team. But, unfortunately, her jump fell short during trials, and she did not qualify for the team. So, the beautiful athlete decided to focus more on different avenues, including her modelling career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c61ec8ba469023c1.png><h3>The photo of Allison Stokke that changed her life</h3><p class=align-left>Before she had a chance to gain recognition for her athletic skills, the young teenager became an overnight <a href=#>celebrity.</a>...but for her body. Unknown to her, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Allison Stokke's</a> picture was taken during a warm-up session in New York, and it accentuated the sexuality of her seventeen-year-old body. Once this photograph became available online, it quickly went viral, accumulating many lewd comments along the way. As a result, she found herself constantly harassed by photographers and overbearing "fans". Her athletic abilities were forgotten, and her body became a sensation.</p>"I worked so hard for pole vaulting and all this other stuff, and it's almost like that doesn't matter. Nobody sees that. Nobody really sees me."<p class=align-left>Although the sudden media attention was overwhelming for the young athlete, being in the spotlight did have an upside. The young pole-vaulter became highly sought after within the sportswear modelling industry, granting her many opportunities to expand her career and personal brand.</p>"I feel like me and that picture are two different people. I feel it has taken on a life of its own. It's like that picture is my alter-ego and sometimes I feel like I use it for a positive force, and sometimes I just choose to leave it out there and not engage with it."<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f8cf1f9d4c87ec5d.png><h3>Allison Stokke's wedding</h3><p class=align-left>This record-breaking pole vaulter officially started dating <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rickie Fowler</a> in April 2017, and they were engaged just over a year later. Fowler is a professional golfer competing in the <i>PGA Tour.</i> In 2007 and 2008, he was the world's top amateur golfer for 36 weeks.</p><p class=align-left>The sports couple got married in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in October of 2019. Their wedding was coordinated by Marcy Blum, owner of a top-rated event and marriage consulting firm. On 21 June 2021, Rickie Fowler and his wife proudly revealed that they are pregnant with a baby girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/cbf0a5259e42e56f.jpg><h3>The Florida mansion</h3><p class=align-left>In 2016, Fowler and his wife moved into an 11,575 sq ft luxury estate that allegedly cost the sports couple $14 million. The mansion features a cinema, a beautiful alfresco kitchen with a built-in fireplace, and a sizeable pool. The property has elegant full-length windows providing them with a panoramic view of the scenery and their private dock.</p><h3>What does Allison Stokke do now?</h3><p class=align-left>Since her disappointment with missing to qualify for the Olympics in 2012, Alison has opted to focus her attention on her modelling career. She has worked for a range of athletic labels, including <i>Nike</i> and<i> Athletica Athleisure </i>in 2015 and <i>Uniqlo </i>in 2016. She also collaborated with <i>GoPro</i> to create thrilling pole-vaulting <i><a href=#>YouTube</a></i> videos that have amassed millions of views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4da11a472af522e5.jpg><p class=align-left>Alison Stokke managed to make the best of an uncomfortable situation, where she was publicly objectified by grown men when she herself was just a teenager. She continued to pursue her pole-vaulting career until 2017, before prioritising her energy into gaining recognition as a sportswear model. We wish her and Fowler the best of luck with the latest addition to their family.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong><a href=#> Tatjana Schoenmaker R850 000 Richer After Heroic Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 Showing</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tatjana Schoenmaker</a>, a South African swim champion, will be richly rewarded for her outstanding performance in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
