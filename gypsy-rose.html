In 2008, “Habitat for Humanity” built them a special house with a ramp.</p><p>In addition, she and her mother became famous after she won the Oley Foundation’s “2007 Child of the Year” award.</p><p>Moreover, the duo also got many offers and donations such as free stays at Ronald McDonald houses, free flights for doctor’s visits, backstage passes to concerts, free Disney World trips, and many more.</p><p>Gypsy’s mother had a mental disorder of always thinking her daughter had some life-threatening health issues. For this, her mother shaved her hair, made her wear glasses, and even confined her to a wheelchair.</p><p>Not only this but her mother also subjected her to several unnecessary surgeries and hid her real age from everyone. As she grew up, Gypsy understood her mother’s misbehaves and wrongdoings. She tried to escape a lot but her mother would always find her beating her.</p><p>At the age of 23, Gypsy met a guy named Nick Godejohn with whom she shared her problems. After that, they started making plans to murder her mother.</p><p>In June 2015, Nick arrived at her house and Gypsy let her in with gloves and tapes. That day, Nick stabbed her mother 17 times to death. She hid in the bathroom so that she couldn’t hear her mother’s screaming.</p><p>After the incident, police held an interrogation in which she revealed her true age, and all the wrongdoings of her mother, and even confessed her crime.</p><p>Therefore, Gypsy was sentenced to jail for 10 years on the conviction of second-degree murder. At present, she is at the jail in Chillicothe Correctional Center. She will probably be out till 2024.</p><h2><span id=Gypsy_Rose_8211_Social_Media>Gypsy Rose – Social Media</span></h2><p>When it comes to her social media availability, Gypsy is only available on Instagram.
