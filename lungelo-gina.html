His injuries were so severe that he was transported to <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dvokolwako Health Centre</a></span> in the hopes of preserving his life.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was declared dead at the hospital upon arrival, despite the unwavering attempts of medical experts to treat him. The specifics of the accident are still unknown at this time. The authorities are still investigating the incident.</p><p><span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Channel N-TV</a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;confirmed his death news through a Facebook post and also shared images of the incident and the car in which Smallz was travelling; they stated in a post:</p><p>“REVEALED: This is the car that took the life of the renowned comedian Lungelo ‘Smallz’ Gina . Gina was with a female occupant who survived. The Comedian was certified dead upon arrival at Dvokolwako Health Centre.”</p><p></p><p>His sudden demise left his fans and loved ones in deep shock and sorrow. Thoughts and Condolences to his family, friends and community in this tragic time; his funeral and memorial services have not been released yet.</p><h2><strong>About Lungelo Gina</strong></h2><p>Smallz, the Comedian, was a well-known comedian who won multiple honors for his exceptional contributions to the industry. He was a devoted performer who worked hard to make his audience laugh and smile.</p><p>Smallz started his career in show business as a “budding actor” in drama with a group named Pelepele. Later in his career, he joined <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ludzeludze’s S’dleke Entertainment House</a></span>, where he was given the moniker “<span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">S’bhintjontjo.</a></span>”</p><p>This platform greatly enhanced his ability to become a more skilled performer and varied artist. Smallz’s educational experiences, which included participating in singing and debating in 2015, were also significant to his growth.</p><p>Later on, he decided to take part in the <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LOL comedy event in South Africa</a></span>, which was organized by <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Manzini North</a></span> Member of Parliament Macford Sibandze. Smallz had significant obstacles during this period that put his skills to the test.</p><p>He also said that Tsepo Maseko, a classmate, gave him the nickname “Smallz” since, in his younger years, he had been relatively small. In the Kingdom of Eswatini, comedic art was long dismissed as unworthy of serious consideration.</p><p>But Smallz was a pathfinder, demonstrating unflinching commitment and diligence. As one of the best comedians in the business, he proudly represented his homeland on national and international stages.</p><p>However, he had a kind heart with a pure soul; he received recognition for his skills and abilities. His loved ones cherish Smallz, and his legacy will always endure. Prayers for him; Rest in Peace, Lungelo Gina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2S5trrGnqOoZZeeu6J7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lynda-randle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lynda Randle">&larr;
