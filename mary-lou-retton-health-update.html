She’s a famous Olympic gymnast, and her family hasn’t shared a lot about her health, but they did say she’s dealing with a rare and serious kind of pneumonia.</p><p>Mary Lou doesn’t have health insurance, which means her medical bills could be really high. To help pay for her care, her daughters are collecting donations. <strong>Here’s what we know about Mary Lou Retton’s health so far</strong>.</p><h2>Mary Lou Retton Health Update</h2><p>Olympic gymnastics star Mary Lou Retton said thanks on Monday to everyone who helped her during a tough time with pneumonia.</p><p><strong>Retton said in an Instagram post</strong>, “I am overwhelmed with the love and support from the world as I fight. I am forever grateful to you all! I’m with family continuing to slowly recover and staying very positive as I know this recovery is a long and slow process.”</p><p>Last week, the family shared that Retton is out of the hospital. She had a rare pneumonia that made it hard for her to breathe, and she couldn’t breathe on her own. It was a tough time but now she’s getting better at home after spending weeks in the hospital.</p><p>According to her daughter, McKenna Kelley, it might take a while for her to recover and be back to 100% healthfully.</p><p>On October 18, her daughters shared that she faced a setback in getting better, even though she had started to improve before. A few days ago, <a href=# rel=noopener>they shared on Instagram</a> that Retton’s “breathing is becoming stronger.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Add-a-heading-62.jpg alt="Mary Lou Retton Health Update" width=1200 height=675 title="Mary Lou Retton Health Update: What Did She Say About Her Condition?" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2 id=is-mary-lou-retton-getting-better>Is Mary Lou Retton Getting Better?</h2><p>She was in the hospital, but now she’s back home and getting better. On October 23, 2023, Retton’s daughter, McKenna Kelley, shared the news on Instagram.</p><p>“Mom is HOME & in recovery mode. We still have a long road of recovery ahead of us, but baby steps,” Kelley&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>wrote on Instagram</a>. “We are overwhelmed with the love and support from everyone. Grateful doesn’t scrape the surface of the posture of our hearts.”</p><p>This update was a relief because just a few days earlier, on <strong>October 19, 2023, Retton faced a difficult setback in her recovery.</strong></p><p><strong>Schrepfer said in an Instagram video</strong>,</p><p>“We were so excited, seeing so much progress and then yesterday we had a pretty scary setback. She is still in ICU and we’re just working through some things as far as her setback goes. So I just wanted to give an update there.”</p><p>Schrepfer said her mother was “really, really exhausted,” “She had a better day today, which is great.”</p><p><strong>Here are some other celebrities illness details we have covered below:</strong></p><h2>Does Mary Lou Retton Have Health Insurance?</h2><p><strong>Mary Lou Retton does not have health insurance</strong>. The main reason is that the United States doesn’t have a government-based healthcare plan for everyone, unlike many other developed countries.</p><p>In Retton’s case, she might have chosen not to get health insurance, maybe because she doesn’t have a full-time job with employer subsidies, or it could be an accidental lapse in coverage. She and her family haven’t explained why she doesn’t have health insurance, and they’re using crowdfunding to pay for her medical expenses.</p><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>follow our Twitter account</a> for more information related to other stars’ health, injuries, surgeries, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXx0fY6mmKuxXaG8tnnRnqutp55itaaty62fZq2gma61sY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./matt-napolitano-husband-who-is-ricky-whitcomb.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matt Napolitano husband: Who is Ricky Whitcomb?">&larr;
