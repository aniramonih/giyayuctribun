The couple is expecting their first child in October 2023.</strong></p><p>The Canadian pair of Taylor and Rachel first began dating in 2017, and since then, many things have happened for Hall on and off the rink.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-hall-wife-rachel-rush.jpg><p>While he was dating Rachel, he played for the New Jersey Devils, Arizona Coyotes, and Buffalo Sabres. When he got engaged and married her, he was with Boston Bruins.&nbsp;</p><p>And now, as he becomes a father for the first time, Taylor will be seen in the colors of the Chicago Blackhawks. He will be playing alongside the NHL veteran <a href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Toews</a> and the No. 1 draft pick of the 2023 NHL, <a href=# rel=noopener>Connor Bedard</a>.</p><h2>Taylor Hall And Wife Rachel Rush Relationship Timeline&nbsp;</h2><p>Taylor Hall’s wife, Rachel Rush, is a graduate of Queen’s University. She hails from Oakville, Ontario, and is the daughter of Brad and Cindy Rush.</p><p>Rachel, born on March 7, 1995, is four years younger than her partner. Rush and Hall were first seen together in 2017, and since then, the hockey players’ fans have only seen growth in his and Rachel’s relationship.&nbsp;</p><h3>Taylor And Rachel Become Instagram Official&nbsp;</h3><p>It was Rachel, who first shared a glimpse of her romantic life on the photo-sharing platform. She posted a cozy-looking winter photo with a man in the streets of Times Square on December 20, 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-hall-rachel-hall.jpg><p>The Ontario native didn’t tag the man in the photo, as many probably wouldn’t have needed it to know who he was. And soon, the picture was filled with comments from Taylor’s fans and her friends, calling them “The Perfect Couple.”</p><p>The former MVP went public with their romance three months later. He shared a picture of him and Rachel at the Gapstow Bridge, Central Park.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rachel Was Beside Taylor When He Won The MVP Award</h3><p>In 2018, Taylor won the NHL MVP award when he was with New Jersey Devils. He had finished sixth in scoring, helping New Jersey to its first playoff birth since 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>He also became the first New Jersey Devils player to win the Hart Trophy. And to celebrate the momentous occasion was his girlfriend Rachel by his side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rachel-taylor-hall.jpg><p>As Taylor was announced the winner, he placed a sweet peck on Rachel’s lips before going on the stage to collect his trophy. Rachel <a href=# rel=noopener>shared the moment</a> on her Instagram, calling it a proud moment.&nbsp;</p><p>That year the couple also celebrated its second Christmas together in Oakville, Ontario, Rachel’s hometown.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Couple Announces Its Engagement&nbsp;</h3><p>The hockey couple’s relationship went from strength to strength. In 2020, the two even adopted a furry baby.&nbsp;</p><p>To his own surprise, Taylor admitted in an Instagram post that he never thought he would be a dog dad, but there he was with a puppy gently placed in his lap with Rachel beside him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-hall-engagement.jpg><p>On June 21, 2021, Rachel and Taylor announced their engagement. The Blackhawks player went down on one knee in Nantucket, Massachusetts, and received a “Yes” as a reply.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel showed off her huge diamond ring on her Instagram handle, and Taylor captioned the series of engagement pictures, “An amazing weekend with my new fiancé!”</p><h3>Rachel And Taylor Tied The Knot In 2022</h3><p>After five years of dating, the NHL couple walked down the aisle at Graydon Manor Hall in North York, Ontario, in August 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-hall-rachel-rush-married.jpg><p>The couple shared some stunning pictures from their wedding ceremony, and Rachel even shared a short snippet of their wedding video.</p><p>It showed Taylor looking at his bride for the first time in her wedding dress and exchanging their vows. The couple enjoyed their honeymoon in the famous couple destination Bora Bora, with Rachel sharing a picture of Taylor carrying her bags during their trip.&nbsp;</p><h2>Taylor Hall And Wife Rachel To Become Parents In October&nbsp;</h2><p>The wedding photographs didn’t stop even after a month after the ceremony. In September 2022, Rachel shared a gallery of images from the most special day of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>Even Taylor shared a snap from his wedding ceremony during this time, but it was a picture of him and his boys in their wedding fit.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-hall-kid.jpg><p>Earlier this year, in April, the couple announced they are going to become parents in October 2023. Rachel shared a photo of a baby onesie with “BABY Hall COMING SOON” written on it.</p><p>The onesie also had the ultrasound picture attached to it, along with a floral decoration.</p><p>Having cared for their furry baby, Leo, for the past two years, Rachel and Taylor may be more than ready to take on their role as human parents.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDAwLKjqKpdna6tuIywoJ%2BdXaeupLTEpWSrraOdeqq%2FjJ6vqZ2Tqbavs4ybmJuxXZ67brvCraabnaJk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-try-guys-ned-fulmer-apologies-affair-daily-lowdown.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Daily Lowdown: The Try Guys Ned Fulmer apologises for affair scandal">&larr;
