She is best known for being the wife of the famous <i>NFL </i>(National Football League) player, <strong>Golden Tate</strong>, who plays the role of wide receiver for the <i>New York Giants</i>.</p><p>Elise was born on 29 January 1988, in San Diego, California, the USA, under the sun sign, Aquarius. Likewise, she belongs to the white ethnic background and holds an American nationality.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wife Of Famous NFL Player</h2><p>Elise is happily married to her long-time boyfriend, Golden Tate. The lovely couple tied the knot on 11 March 2017, in Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. Their wedding ceremony was a small ceremony with the presence of their close friends and relatives at the seaside. At the nuptials, they ordered a cake, which was huge, and their marriage ceremony lasted until 5 am of the next morning.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/1/66701178_2488567491426935_4340048322456714986_n-1577860888180.jpg><p>She was looking beautiful and charming in her custom-designed gown, whereas Golden was shining in his blue and black suit. The two first met in 2012 and started dating since then, and now they are married couples. It has been two years of their successful marriage, and they are living quite a blissful life.</p><p>Furthermore, she often uploads pictures of her husband and their children on her Instagram account, where she has over<i> </i>54,300 followers. She is among the well-known celebrity wives, such as <a href=#><strong>Michelle Newton</strong></a>.</p><h2>Engagement On Her Hometown</h2><p>Well, Golden proposed Elise in her hometown, San Diego, while he was playing for the Detroit Lions on 12 September 2015. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Heavy</strong></a>, he worked with Chase Gregory to custom-made the engagement ring for Elise.</p><p>He further added that he kept a surprise about the expensive ring from her. Tate was thrilled that it all worked out, and they are now married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/1/elise-pollard-e1489604059307%20(1)-1577861072751.jpg><p>Without a doubt, the proposal went very well as she happily agreed, and later, Tate throws a surprise engagement party.</p><h2>Blessed With Two Children</h2><p>Elise and Golden are currently parents of two children. Initially, the pair welcomed their first child, a daughter named <strong>Londyn Tate</strong>. Similarly, they added the fourth member of their family this late February 2019. They named their second child, a son, <strong>Golden Tate II</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/1/78884237_2510003295884360_6308067575413742683_n%20(1)-1577861157203.jpg><p>They announced their Tate II birth through an Instagram post with an image of him and a caption,</p><p>"Although you're rarely awake for us to tell you, we couldn't be more in love with you, son. These past five days have been a dream come true; it's hard to put into words the overwhelming feeling of love and thankfulness in our home right nowâ€¦ but we feel complete."</p><p>Unfortunately, their second son cost her husband for four games ban as he took fertility treatment pills before games, which was banned by the league.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Elise Tate</h2><p>Elise has not involved in any money-making activities in the present time. For now, she is focusing on her motherhood, raising her little kids and house-keeping. She was an employee at the Harvey Nash staffing and recruiting group in her past days.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/1/Elise%20and%20Golden%20Tate-1577865940382.JPG><p>So, she might have earned a decent amount of fortune from her previous careers, and her estimated net worth is around <strong>$100,000</strong> as of 2019, which is similar to the net worth of <a href=#><strong>Dixie Brubaker</strong></a>.</p><p>Apart from her earnings, her husband, Golden's net worth, is estimated at around <strong>$37,500,000</strong> as per the four-year contract with New York Giants. He earned this massive wealth through his successful career as a NFL player. Surely, she must be living a lavish lifestyle along with his husband's earnings and net worth.</p><p><i><strong>Keep Visiting </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more updates on Celebrity Wife!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6joquVYsGiwMQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicola-bulley-autopsy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicola Bulley Autopsy: What is the Reason of Her Death?">&larr;
