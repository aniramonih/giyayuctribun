The <a href=#>news</a> of her death was announced and confirmed by her children, who shared their grief in a statement, expressing their sadness at the loss of their mother.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CelebrityNetWorth</a>, Cindy Williams had an estimated net worth of $10 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Cindy Williams was best known for her role in the iconic television series “Laverne & Shirley,” which aired from 1976 to 1983.&nbsp;</p><p>She starred alongside <a href=#>Penny Marshall</a> as Shirley Feeney, and together they portrayed the hilarious and endearing duo of best friends working as bottle-cappers in a brewery.&nbsp;</p><p>The show was a hit and became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time, earning Williams critical acclaim and a huge following of fans.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Williams was also known for her philanthropic efforts. She was actively involved in numerous charitable organizations and was dedicated to giving back to her <a href=#>community</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Her kindness, generosity, and beautiful spirit touched the lives of many, and she will always be remembered as a true star.</p><p>The net worth that Williams accumulated from her successful career in entertainment was significant, making her one of the wealthiest actresses of her time. Despite her <a href=#>wealth</a> and fame, she remained grounded and dedicated to her family and friends.</p><p>As one of the few surviving cast members from the highly acclaimed 1970s sitcom “Laverne & Shirley,” Cindy Williams gained substantial recognition and <a href=#>wealth</a>.</p><p>She began her acting career with commercial work before gradually transitioning to film and television. Her breakthrough came in 1975 when she starred as Shirley Feeney in five episodes of the American hit sitcom “Happy Days.”</p><p>Her chemistry with her on-screen partner, Penny Marshall, who played Laverne DeFazio, was so strong that they were given their own spin-off show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did “Laverne & shirley” contribute to Cindy’s net worth?</h2><p>“Laverne & Shirley” was an instant success and became one of the most popular sitcoms in the United States. This show made Williams and Marshall household names, solidifying their place in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Not only did “Laverne & Shirley” bring Cindy Williams and Penny Marshall immense fame and recognition, but it also contributed significantly to their financial prosperity.&nbsp;</p><p>The show first aired in 1976 and ran for a total of 159 episodes over eight seasons. In 1978, the New York Times reported that each episode of the show was budgeted at $200,000. When adjusted for inflation, this amounts to approximately $897,000 per episode.</p><p>A significant portion of the budget went towards compensating the two leading actresses, with Williams and Marshall earning millions from their roles in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1982, Williams even sued Paramount for $20 million, seeking compensation for the episodes she would miss due to her pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Hollywood Reporter, Paramount ultimately settled with Williams for an undisclosed amount, and she was written out of the show.</p><p>In conclusion, the passing of Cindy Williams has left a void in the hearts of her loved ones, fans, and the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Her talent, kindness, and humor will be greatly missed, and she will always be remembered as a true icon of the entertainment world.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvyKebsmWnnrmttcCmqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./darlene-love-family-husband-children-parents-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Darlene Love family, husband, children, parents, siblings">&larr;
