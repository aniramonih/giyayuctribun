He was an author, director, screenwriter, and producer, best known for his various best-selling novels. He has written books that have sold over 200 million copies internationally and a lot of them have been made into films. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it was prior to his passing.</p><p>How rich is Michael Crichton? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $175 million, mostly earned through a successful career as a writer. He was responsible for the creation of many hits including “Disclosure”, “Jurassic Park”, and “ER”. He was called one of the pioneers of the techno-thriller genre and all of these ensured the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Michael Crichton Net Worth $175 million</h3><p>Michael had developed an interest in writing at a very young age and it may have been due to the journalistic influence of his father. At the age of 14, he had already published an article in The New York Times and later attended Harvard College in 1960. He studied literature, but then decided to switch to biological anthropology because of politics with one of his professors. He was then given a Henry Russel Shaw Travelling Fellowship and also taught in the University of Cambridge in the UK. He then attended Harvard Medical School where he started writing once again, making novels under pen names such as John Lange. In 1969, he won his first Edgar Award for Best Novel for his work “A Case of Need”. He graduated from Harvard in the same year but never pursued a medical license, instead opting to fully dedicate himself to writing.</p><p>Crichton’s first novel was called “Odds On” which he wrote under the pen name John Lange. A year later he wrote “Scratch One” which was about a lawyer who is mistaken for an assassin. In 1968, he wrote two novels “A Case of Need” and “Easy Go” which was about an Egyptologist who discovers a hidden message leading to an un-named Pharaoh whose tomb is yet to be discovered. The following year, he would make more books including “Zero Cool”, “The Venom Business”, and “The Andromeda Strain” which solidified his status as a best-selling author. The book was a bout a group of scientists discovering an extra-terrestrial microorganism that causes death via blood clotting. In 1970, he wrote “Grave Descent”, Drug of Choice”, and “Dealing: or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues” which he made with his younger brother. Two years later he wrote “Binary” and “The Terminal Man” which was eventually made into a film in 1974 but didn’t receive much attention.</p><p>Crichton would continue to show his versatility with the historical novel “The Great Train Robbery”, and the scientific “Eaters of the Dead”. In 1980, he wrote “Congo” which would become a film starring <a href=#>Laura Linney</a>. Seven years later, he created “Sphere” which was then made into a film starring <a href=#>Dustin Hoffman</a>. He also wrote “Jurassic Park” which would eventually become a hit movie franchise. He continued working with <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> and they would create the series “ER” and would then make another novel made into a film in “Rising Sun”. He continued making more novels with “Disclosure” and “The Lost World” which was a sequel to Jurassic Park.</p><p>In 1999, he wrote “Timeline” which would then lead to the video game of the same name. He then created “Prey” and “State of Fear” which would reach the number 1 spot on Amazon.com. The last published book he had was “Next” and after his death, it was discovered he had two manuscripts “Pirate Latitudes” and “Micro” that were partially completed.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Crichton was a workaholic and would spend a lot of time writing his novels. Aside from that, he practiced a meditation and was a deist. He married five times during his life which was to Joan Radam, Kathleen St. Johns, Suzanna Childs, and actress Anne-Marie Martin. His last marriage was to Sherri Alexander who was pregnant with their son when he died.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=35.683706070288><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Michael Crichton</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$175 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 23, 1942</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>November 4, 2008, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 9" (2.06 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Author</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Education</td><td>Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Harvard College, Roslyn High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Spouse</td><td>Sherri Alexander (m. 2005–2008), Anne-Marie Martin (m. 1987–2003), Suzanne Childs (m. 1981–1983), Kathy St. Johns (m. 1978–1980), Joan Radam (m. 1965–1970)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Taylor Anne Crichton , John Michael Todd Crichton</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Zula Miller Crichton, John Henderson Crichton</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Douglas Crichton, Catherine Crichton, Kimberly Crichton</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000341/</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Awards</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, Edgar Award for Best Novel, Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay, Academy Award for Best Technical Achievement, Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Long Form – Original, PGA Televisio...</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, Edgar Award for Best Paperback Original, Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, Nebula Award for Best Script, Prometheus Award for Best Novel</td></tr><tr readability=24><td>Movies</td><td>Westworld, Jurassic Park, Jurassic World, The 13th Warrior, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Congo, Sphere, Timeline, Disclosure, The First Great Train Robbery, Rising Sun, Twister, Looker, Runaway, Jurassic Park III, The Terminal Man, The Carey Treatment, The Andromeda Strain, Physical Evidence, Coma...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>ER, Beyond Westworld</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Known for doing exhaustive research</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Often expresses complex scientific terminology and theories in more layman's terms</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Towering height and slender frame</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Tells the story through multiple characters' viewpoints</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Cautionary tales about the dangers of technology</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td><a href=#>Twister</a> (1996)</td><td>$2,500,000</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=38.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Books aren't written - they're rewritten.
