Unopened packages of Pillsbury dough have a longer shelf-life compared to opened ones. If an unopened package is stored in the freezer, it can last up to 2-3 months past its expiration date. Freezing the dough helps preserve its freshness and quality, allowing you to enjoy it even after its initial shelf-life has expired.<p>On the other hand, if you’ve already opened a package of Pillsbury dough, it’s best to use it as soon as possible. Opened dough should be consumed within 3-5 days of being opened to ensure optimal quality.</p><p>However, if you’ve stored your Pillsbury dough properly in either the refrigerator or freezer, you may still be able to use it for up to 2 weeks after its expiration date. Storing the dough at lower temperatures slows down bacterial growth and helps prevent spoilage.</p><p>Regardless of whether your Pillsbury dough is opened or unopened, always check for any signs of spoilage before using it. Look out for mold growth, a sour smell, discoloration, dryness, excessive moisture, or slime. If any of these indicators are present, discard the dough immediately and do not consume it.</p><p>To maximize the shelf life and freshness of your Pillsbury dough for longer periods:</p><p>1. Keep unopened cans in a cool and dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources.<br>2. Refrigerate or freeze opened Pillsbury dough in an airtight container to prevent moisture loss and maintain texture.<br>3. Inspect for signs of spoilage before consuming.</p><p>By following these guidelines and storing your Pillsbury dough properly, you can extend its usability and enjoy delicious baked goods with peace of mind even past its expiration date.<br></p><h2>What other sources of income contributed to Stephen Hillenburg’s overall net worth?</h2><br>How did Stephen Hillenburg accumulate a net worth of $120 million from SpongeBob SquarePants?<p>Stephen Hillenburg, the visionary creator and producer of the beloved animated series SpongeBob SquarePants, not only left an indelible mark on popular culture but also amassed an impressive net worth throughout his career.
