His parents are award-winning actress, Lisa Kudrow, and French advertising executive, Michel Stern. Julian’s mom hails from a family of respected physicians and for several years worked for her dad as a research assistant. He later noticed her artistic talent and urged her to try out for the Groundlings Improv Theater which marked her entry into showbiz.</p><p>Lisa Kudrow officially commenced her career in 1989 and since then, she has featured in highly-acclaimed movies such as The Opposite of Sex, Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion, and P.S. I Love You. She is however most famous for her role as the quirky, air-head, massage therapist, Phoebe, on the iconic NBC sitcom, Friends. Kudrow appeared on Friends for 10 years and won many awards, including the Primetime Emmy award for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series.</p><p>On the other hand, Julian Stern’s dad is a French-born advertising executive named Michel Stern. Stern grew up in France but relocated to New York which is where he crossed paths with Kudrow in the late ’80s. At that time, she was still in college and he happened to be <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>dating her roommate</a>. She fancied him but didn’t dare try anything funny. As fate would have it, he and the roommate later broke up but remained friends. Six years after the breakup, the said roommate had her birthday party and both Kudrow and Michel were in attendance. They got talking and soon started dating.</p><p>Julian Murray Stern’s parents dated for some time before tying the knot on the 27th day of 1995 in Los Angeles. The couple remains together to date and they are still crazy about each other. Some of the secrets to their successful union include the fact that they continuously work hard on their relationship and respect each other’s independence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/10/Julian-Murray-Stern.jpg><h2><strong>He Was Born at the Height of His Mother’s Fame on the Set of Friends and His Birth Was Written into the Script</strong></h2><p>Julian Murray Stern’s parents were officially married for about two years before they discovered that they were pregnant with him. This was obviously great news for them but it also proved a bit problematic, given that his mom was playing the role of a non-pregnant Phoebe on the TV show, Friends.</p><p>Her character appeared in all the episodes and as such, it was a bit difficult trying to shoot around the pregnancy. The showrunners, therefore, decided to make it a part of the plot and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>the storyline</a> became that Phoebe’s half-brother, Frank, and his wife, Alicia, could not conceive a child. Phoebe, therefore, agrees to help them out and be their surrogate mother via IVF.</p><p>This way, Julian’s mom was able to continue her iconic role on Friends despite her pregnancy. She eventually gave birth to him in real life while on the show she had triplets, namely Frank Jr., Leslie, and Chandler. The little Julian was every inch a member of the Friends’ family. While his mother was pregnant with him, her fellow stars would often whisper to the unborn child that they loved him.</p><p>By the time his mother gave birth to him, she often took him with her on set and he got to play with them, especially co-star Jennifer Aniston. She would play and cuddle with him and he even started referring to her as <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>mummy</a> whenever he saw her on T.V.</p><p>Despite this close affinity, Julian Murray Stern never appeared in an episode of Friends. He was never crazy about the show but preferred action films while growing up. To date, he has only seen some of the episodes and this is because he felt he had to and not because he found it so interesting. Julian is however not unmindful of the impact of the show and during the Friends reunion show in May 2021, he told his mom that he was really proud of her and her achievements.</p><h2><strong>He Has Joined His Parents on the Red Carpet on Several Occasions</strong></h2><p>Julian Murray Stern may have been born into the spotlight but his parents made sure to strike the right balance between what they made public and what they kept private about him. They shielded the intimate details of his life from the public but also made sure that he did not end up with a hermit lifestyle.</p><p>They, therefore, took him to the red carpet on various important occasions. A five-year-old Julian joined his mom at the premiere of Looney Tunes in 2003. He also accompanied his mom to a P.S. Arts Event in 2013. Julian was also there for the launch of one of his mother’s latest movies, Booksmart, in 2019.</p><p>There is no doubt that Julian’s parents love him very much and his mother regularly sends him <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>birthday wishes</a> on social media each year. She has also been dishing on some aspects of his life, including the fact that he was okay with being an only child and never wanted to have <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>another brother or sister</a>. He made his wishes known from the day he could speak and according to his mom, is thankful to this very day for the fact that he is an only child.</p><h2><strong>A 2021 Graduate Of USC, Julian Murray Stern is an Aspiring Filmmaker</strong></h2><p>As at the time that Julian Murray Stern was born in 1998, Friends was only in its fourth year. He, therefore, spent a major portion of his childhood on the set of the show, as well as other projects that his mom subsequently worked on. This filled him with a natural appreciation of the movie industry and he decided to become a filmmaker.</p><p>Upon completing his high school diploma, Julian Murray enrolled at the USC School of Cinematic Arts to study film and television production. He did well in his studies and graduated with a bachelor of fine arts and cinematic arts in May 2021. It was indeed a momentous occasion for the young man and he took to his Instagram page to celebrate. His mom was also overjoyed and remarked that she was happy and proud.</p><p>The graduation marks the formal commencement of Julian’s career pursuits but even during his school days, he had shown great promise. As a teenager, Julian Murray worked in the makeup and special effects department for several movies such as Shadow of the Vampire, Captain America, Prometheus, and Harry Porter.</p><p>He also supplied similar skills to the hit TV series, Game of Thrones, in 2015. Julian Murray also directed a short film, Mind Made Up, as his junior thesis project in 2019. The movie was selected for screening at the Portland Comedy Festival in May 2021, which is no mean feat, and an overjoyed Julian took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a> to share the page.</p><h2><strong>FAQs about Julian Murray Stern</strong></h2><li><strong>Who are Julian Murray Stern’s parents?</strong> Julian Murray Stern is the son of actress Lisa Kudrow and her husband Michel Stern.
