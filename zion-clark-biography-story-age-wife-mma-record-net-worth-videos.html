When Clark found out what the judges had decided, he was so happy that he did a backflip back to his corner, which amazed everyone watching.</p><h2><strong>Zion Clark Biography, Story, Age, Wife, MMA Record, Net Worth, Videos, Instagram</strong></h2><p>Zion Clark was born in Columbus, Ohio, on September 29, 1997. He was born without legs because of a rare birth defect called Caudal Regression Syndrome. Zion was given up for adoption soon after he was born. His mother wasn’t able to take care of him, and he didn’t have a father.</p><p>His childhood was a disaster in the making. He moved around between foster homes and was called a “problem child,” which made the system give up on him quickly. Zion didn’t let his abusive living situation stop him from learning new skills. He started wrestling and playing music at a young age, which gave him a way to escape.</p><p>Zion didn’t give up and kept trying to figure out how to pursue some of his passions. This helped him become an All-American wrestler and the lead drummer at his church. He keeps going against all odds with his positive attitude and “no excuses” attitude.</p><p>Zion Clark’s girlfriend is Bodacious Teitei, a model who lives in Harlem, New York City who he is engaged to. His net worth stands at $250,000 with the 25 year old having a professional MMA record of 1-0-0.</p><p>AGE, 25 / Sep 29, 1997. HEIGHT, 3’2″ / 96.52 cm. WEIGHT, 135 lbs / 61.23 kg. ASSOCIATION Team Bodyshop CLASS Bantamweight STYLE Wrestling</p><h4>Zion Clark’s Stint In Wrestling</h4><p>He started wrestling when he was in elementary school. At first, he wasn’t very good at it. In fact, he didn’t win a match for a few years. When Zion went to Massillon High School, he met Coach Gil Donahue, who saw how much he loved sports and how hard he worked. It was the start of a great friendship.</p><p>Over the next three years, Zion got better at wrestling and worked out like he was on fire. Then, something amazing happened! Zion was recruited to wrestle by a number of colleges, but he chose to go to Kent State. Where he spent the next two years steadily getting better and having success at the varsity level.</p><h4>Zion Decided To Take On His Hardest Challenge</h4><p>Zion Clark would be the first American athlete to compete in both the Olympic (wrestling) and Paralympic (wheelchair racing) Games in Tokyo (2020).</p><p>During his senior year, a Hollywood producer followed Zion on his journey and made a movie about it. The movie “Zion” was praised by critics at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and got a lot of attention around the world (it’s now on Netflix). Zion is also a motivational speaker, which keeps him busy in addition to his hard training and practise schedule.</p><p>The moral of Zion’s inspiring story is that life isn’t always easy. But if you want to do well, you have to change to fit your own situation.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Zion Clark won his MMA debut tonight via UD.</p><p>Absolute legend!
