Liz Cheney’s husband was born on 16th October 1964 and is 59 years old.<br></strong></p><p>A former political appointee as the General Counsel of the US Department of Homeland Security between 2005 and 2009 during the administration of former President George W. Bush, Philip has earned huge respect as an important community member – locally, in San Diego County, CA, on the national, and even at the international level. He lives and works in Washington, D.C., but he appears to have decided to stay out of the political spotlight for the meantime since returning to private practice with Latham and Watkins LLP.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Philip Perry’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Philip Jonathan Perry</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Litigation Trailblazer</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> October 16, 1964</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Age:</strong> 59 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Libra</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Wife:</strong> Elizabeth Cheney</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Children:</strong> Grace Perry, Kate Perry, Elizabeth Perry, Richard Perry, Philip Perry</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Height in Inches:</strong>&nbsp;6 feet 1 inch</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 185 cm</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Weight:</strong> 70 kg</li><li><strong>Philip Perry’s Net Worth:</strong> $5 million (approx.)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> His legal work under former US President George W. Bush</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Phillip Perry?</strong></h2><p>Philip Perry is currently 59 years old. He was born on October 19, 1964. That much we know, but besides his date of birth, there is little to nothing to scavenge anywhere online. All information about his birth family and kin (his dad, mom, and siblings) remain unavailable. However, his wife, Liz Cheney, was born on the 28th of July 1966, and she is the daughter of Lynee and Dick Cheney, a former vice president of America.</p><p>We do not have details of the elementary school Philip Perry attended, but we know that he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Colorado College in 1986 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Cornell Law School in 1990.</p><p>Liz also attended Colorado College, Colorado but received her Juris Doctor degree from Chicago Law School in 1996. He has taken courses in middle eastern history at the Oriental Institute.</p><h2><strong>Philip Perry Met Liz Cheney in College</strong></h2><p>Philip and Liz met each other while pursuing their academic degree at Colorado College. Details about their meeting and whether it was love at first sight are not available to the public. But considering that they both share similar career ambitions, they must have bonded intellectually.</p><p>The love birds got married in 1993 and have remained together since. Three decades after, their union is blessed with five children; Grace Perry, Kate Perry, Elizabeth Perry, Richard Perry, and Philip Perry Jr. Over the years, Philip’s children have managed to keep their lives offline and away from the spotlight, and consequently there’s no such information about any of them.</p><h2><strong>Who is Philip Perry’s Wife, Liz Cheney?</strong></h2><p>Elizabeth Cheney is an American politician and a member of the US Republican Party. The 57-year-old has been the U.S. Representative for Wyoming’s Congressional District since 2017. She used to be known as the daughter of the former Vice President, but she has built a strong political name and legacy for herself.</p><p>On the 3rd of January 2019, Liz Cheney became the Chair of the House Republican Conference, which is the House Republican leadership’s third highest position. She was one of the representatives who voted for the impeachment of Donald Trump in 2021. As a result of her stance against the then-US President, Donald Trump, she was removed from her position as Chair of the House Republican Conference in May 2021.</p><p>She currently serves as the Vice Chair of the House January 6th Committee and the Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Wyoming’s at-large district. In May 2021, during an interview with ABC News’s This Week, Liz Cheney said she would like to be the leader and will help in the fight to restore the party. Her statement caused speculations that she may be keen on running for the presidency at some point.</p><h2><strong>A Look at Philip Perry’s Career&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As stated earlier, Philip Perry is an American attorney who served as a political appointee during the administration of George W. Bush. Major highlights of his career can be traced back to 1997 when he served as counsel to United States Senate hearings on campaign finance misuse during the 1996 presidential election campaign.</p><p>In 2000, he was Dick Cheney’s advisor for the Vice Presidential debate and also a policy advisor for the Bush-Cheney presidential transition team. He has also served as the acting Attorney-General of the US Department of Justice.</p><p>In 2002, Philip Perry started working in the White House as a General Counsel for the Office of Management and Budget. In this role, he was responsible for drafting legislation, mediating interagency disputes, and clearance of federal regulations, to mention but a few. After working for the federal government for several years, Philip Perry moved to private practice as a partner with Latham & Watkins.</p><p>Philip Perry’s net worth has maintained a bullish direction for a long time, and right now, he is clocking around $5 million in value. He and his wife have a combined net worth of about $12 million.</p><h2><strong>Philip Was Accused of Affiliation with the Chinese Government</strong></h2><p>In an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">article</a> published by the National Pulse in May 2021, it was revealed that Perry’s law firm, Latham and Watkins LLP, works in close contact with several clients who have links to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The firm, which has offices in China, has been labeled “tools” of the Chinese Communist Party by the U.S. State Department and People’s Liberation Army collaborators. It is said that the law advising has been advising Tencent (a Chinese company) over its investment in an American organization.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/phil-perry-liz-cheney.jpg alt="Philip Perry" width=696 height=414 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Tencent is a big Chinese tech company suspected of being handled by the Chinese government, in accordance with the Federal government press release. To enlarge its market share in the Chinese market, the company has recruited a number of defunct Chinese Communist Party members.</p><p>Since China has been labeled an antagonistic nation, this information has indeed brought him and his wife, Elizabeth Cheney, under the suspicion of law enforcement agencies as well as the public.</p><h3><strong>Philip Perry is Not as Active on Social Media</strong></h3><p>Philip Perry doesn’t seem to have any verified Instagram, Twitter, or even Facebook accounts. No trace at all of any presence on social media. However, the same cannot be said about his better half, Liz Cheney.</p><p>The wife of the Litigation Trailblazer doesn’t share such traits and has her Instagram filled with pictures of meetings, conferences, and significant community events. Her Twitter is also not quiet about the happenings in the state and country. She has about 50k followers on Instagram and roughly ten times that on Twitter. That is not bad for the Wyoming representative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC5xJ6rZqiYnrmqvIypnKuqqWK5qsaMnJ%2BeppWuwG601KyZmqaUYrynecCbpq6sXWh6pbHCmpueq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-dockery-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Dockery Height">&larr;
