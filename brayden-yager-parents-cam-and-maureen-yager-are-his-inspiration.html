Cam was previously a hockey player and traded his hockey skills to become a jail guard.</strong></p><p>The 19-year-old previously played for Mosse Jaw Warriors in the WHL. Before that, he played two seasons of hockey with his older brother, Connor Yager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brayden-yager-nhl.jpg><p>His brother might’ve given up on hockey dreams, but Brayden continued his passion. And after his stunning last season with the Warriors in 2022, Brayden finds himself among the first-round pick in the 2023 NHL Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>Pittsburgh Penguins picked Brayden as the 14th overall pick in the 2023 Draft. <a href=# rel=noopener>Connor Bedard</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Leo Carlsson</a> were the top two picks in the draft, with Adam Faintilli slotting in as the third overall pick.&nbsp;</p><h2>Brayden Yager Parents Cam, And Maureen Yager</h2><p>Brayden Yager’s parents, Cam and Maureen Yager, raised two athletic sons in Saskatoon, Canada. As said by Brayden, he grew up in a strict household cultivated by his parents.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Sports Net</a>, Yager said his parents, Cam and Maureen, instilled hard work in him from a young age. This helped him to become a better player, and today he stands as a first-round pick in the NHL Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>Brayden’s father, Cam Yager, is a former hockey player and played goalie at the University of Saskatchewan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brayden-yager-parents.jpg><p>Cam started his hockey career in 1989, playing for Saskatoon Blazers U18 AAA, and a year later played for North Battleford North Stars in The Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.&nbsp;</p><p>He spent one more season in SJHL with Nipawin Hawk before moving to play for Detroit Falcons in the Colonial Hockey League.</p><p>The father of two ended his hockey career at the University of Saskatchewan and later chose a path completely different from that of a hockey player.&nbsp;</p><p>In his previous interview, it was revealed that Cam worked as a jail guard and often clocked 12-hour overnight shifts. But the doting dad would be ready every morning to take his two sons to hockey practice.&nbsp;</p><p>His parents aren’t big on social media and have kept themselves away from the public limelight. His dad and mom have both retired from their respective jobs, as his mother previously worked as the warden’s assistant.</p><h2>Brayden Yager Brother, Connor Yager, Is A Former Hockey Player&nbsp;</h2><p>Connor Yager, the older brother of Brayden Yager, was born on May 29, 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>Standing at 5ft 10, Connor played as a forward and began his hockey career with the Saskatoon Maniacs U-15 squad in 2016. He played 30 games in his first season and earned 12 points for his team.&nbsp;</p><p>The next season, Connor played for the Martensville Marauders U-15 squad and earned 38 points in 29 games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brayden-yager-brother.jpg><p>He continued the next season with Martensville, playing nine fewer games and earning only 12 points. Connor began the 2019 season with Saskatoon Contacts U-18 and played 36 games, earning 19 points.&nbsp;</p><p>During the season, Connor moved to the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League to play for Melville Millionaires. But it was a short stay as he only played two games.&nbsp;</p><p>For his last season as a hockey player, Connor played only six games in the 2020 season and didn’t earn a single point. Unlike his brother, Connor might’ve thought that hockey wasn’t the right fit for him.&nbsp;</p><p>He is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> with the username @&nbsp; connor.yager_&nbsp; but has kept his account private.&nbsp; Brayden has previously shared a few snaps with his brother on his Instagram handle, which came earlier this year as they welcomed 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCu0ZqwnZ2eYsais8SrZKmZopq7tb%2BMnJimZZGjsW65wK6pnp2eYsais8SrZJqqlWK1qr%2BMoqWsqJmnrrW1zqdm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./can-singles-go-to-hedonism-resorts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can singles go to Hedonism Resorts?">&larr;
