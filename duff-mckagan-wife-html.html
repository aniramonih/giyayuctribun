Together, the couple&nbsp;has two daughters. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Both McKagan and his wife have talked about their relationship on multiple occasions. In many, the duo has also revealed why their marriage has lasted for so long.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And one of the major reasons, as the two of them have said, is trust. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When asked about how he remained faithful to Holmes while on tour and not fall to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">temptation of groupies</a>, McKagan said he could never do such a thing to his spouse. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>“Honestly, it never enters my head. For starters, I could just never do that to my wife,” he shared.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“And it’s not even a case that I have to think about it. It just doesn’t even enter my mind at all.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Holmes has also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared her thoughts</a> about the topic, saying there was immense trust and respect between her and McKagan. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She further added that any relationship took a lot of work. “Like in any relationship, you have to keep putting back into it and not just resting on those laurels.”</p><h2>How Duff McKagan Met Wife Susan Holmes</h2><p>McKagan met Holmes for the first time in 1996 when they were set up on a blind date by a friend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Initially, Holmes had hesitations about furthering her relationship with McKagan, one of the biggest rock stars of his time.</p><p>She also shared that she had asked him about picking him up at his house instead of the other way around, as she wasn’t sure if she wanted him to have her address.</p><p>“It’s just funny looking back because he’s far from that,” she said of her initial thoughts on him. “He’s a true gentleman.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Duff McKagan with wife Susan Holmes</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Duff McKagan and Wife Have Two Children Together</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A year into their relationship, McKagan and Holmes welcomed their first child together, daughter Grace “Grave” Elizabeth, in August 1997.</p><p>Two years later, the pair tied the knot on August 28, 1999.</p><p>In July 2020, their family of three grew larger when Holmes gave birth to daughter Mae Marie.</p><p>Their older daughter Grace is following in McKagan’s footsteps. She has uploaded several of her songs and their music videos to her YouTube channel, including ‘One You Love,’ ‘Baby That’s Rock N Roll,’&nbsp;and ‘So Hyper.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Aside from pursuing a career in music, McKagan revealed in November 2021 that Grace was also working to become a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CorePower Yoga instructor</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for their daughter Mae, she is a full-time student and a part-time model.</p><h2>Keeping The Romance Alive</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Both McKagan and Holmes have opened up about how they make their relationship work.</p><p>Aside from genuine trust and respect for each other, Holmes revealed it was important to allow each other space.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>“Of course, we enjoy each other’s company,” she said. “But he has to go off on tour and I’m working on my own stuff.”</p><p>Another thing that Holmes thought had worked in favor of their relationship was the opportunity to travel a lot. She shared that change in scenery is a good thing in a relationship and that it helped keep the romance alive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJylm7NuucKkmKCZnmLEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-work-hours-is-9am-to-6pm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many work hours is 9am to 6pm">&larr;
