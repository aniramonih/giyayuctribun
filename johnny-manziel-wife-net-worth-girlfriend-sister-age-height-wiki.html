Johnathan Paul Manziel made history during his football days in both high school and University, thus obtaining outstanding nominations and awards such as the Heisman Trophy in 2012 as a freshman (the first freshman to achieve the feat).</p><p>He was drafted in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft by Cleveland Browns. He may not be among the well-known football names as he has been embroiled/plagued with many issues; few of which we will bring to the fore as well as details about his bio, height, girlfriend or wife who his sister may be among other facts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=johnny-manziel-bio-age></span><strong>Johnny Manziel Bio, (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Johnny Football was born as Johnathan Paul Manziel on the 6th day of December 1992 in Tyler, Texas. While growing up, little Johnny Manziel excelled in all forms of sports which included basketball, baseball, and golf. His football career began from his first year at Tivy High school where he focused mainly on football and baseball sports. He started first as a receiver but would later change his playing position to a quarterback.</p><p>He completed his junior year as a quarterback with impressive 2.903 passing yards, 1,544 rushing yards, 152 receiving yards and 55 touchdowns which earned him the votes for Antonio Area Offensive Player of the year and the District 27-4A MVP. In his senior season, Johnny Manziel recorded more feats thereby garnering more awards and recognition.</p><p>His impressive high school football records made him the choice of many schools who wished to have him play for them, but Johnny eventually settled for Texas A&M University and was redshirted in 2011. In the 2012 season, which marked his freshman season, he recorded laudable achievements; including the winning of Heisman Trophy and the Davey O’Brien National Quarterback Award. He went on to surprise his fans and supporters with the incredible statistics he recorded in his college career.</p><p>Johnny Manziel forfeited his junior season in January of 2014 to enter the 2014 NFL draft, making it, as a first-round pick and drafted as the 22nd overall by the Cleveland Browns. Unfortunately, had a very shambolic start in his Cleveland debut in a pre-season game against Washington Redskins. He was fined $12,000 for a hand gesture and he was dropped with his teammate, Brian Hoyer, taking the position of the starter.</p><p>The two seasons Johnny spent with the Browns (2014 & 2015), he played a total of 15 games and started eight of them, with seven touchdowns and seven interceptions. He parted ways with the Browns on March 11, 2016, but not without receiving salaries worth about $7,707,913.</p><p>Johnny Manziel career was paused for a year after he got himself enmeshed in several controversies and issues in and out of pitch which bordered on legal actions with regards to his poor attitude and addiction problems. Luck, however, smailed on him and he was eventually signed by the Tiger-Cats on May 19, 2018, and traded off to the Montreal Alouettes of Canadian Football League (CFL). He would later join the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) before the AAF abruptly suspended football operations ending the 2019 season.</p><p>The footballer is already seeking another opportunity to return back to his first love – the American National Football League in order to have a fresh start in his career and as well change his name – from Johnny to John – to complete his transition. Talk about awards and recognitions, Johnny has a handful of them in his gallery.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-%e2%80%93-sister></span><strong>Family – Sister</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Johnny Manziel is the son of Michelle and Paul Manziel.

They walked down the aisle on March 14, 2018, in a private ceremony at California courthouse.</p><p>One year down the line, the duo separated amidst rumors of his infidelity against Bre who had traveled out the state on vacation without him. Johnny Manziel emotional apology epistle to his beloved wife on Instagram gave credence to the rumors. He revealed his separation from his wife on March 28, 2019, via his social media handle.</p><p>Breana Tiesi is a model, outgoing dancer, and actress born on March 4, 1991, in Los Angeles.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-net-worth-of-johnny-manziel></span><strong>What Is The Net Worth Of Johnny Manziel?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Johnny Manziel has not had the best of career since he started playing professional football in 2014, he has however pocketed a lot of money from football.
