The 58-year-old claimed that the attack happened "so fast" and that the <a href=# rel>unknown attacker</a> "was gone as fast as she appeared."</p><p>The Z100 host explained during his morning broadcast on Tuesday, April 4, that the aggressor approached him as he was turning onto 14th St from 6th Ave. "Her fist comes toward my face, and <a href=# rel>it's holding, like, a sharp object</a>, and she tries to cut my face," Duran reportedly alleged, adding, "I put my arm up, and I stopped her from doing it, and she did it to the woman behind her. We were all shocked." Duran added, "She almost cut me. It is crazy! I hope no one else got hurt."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Nothing but cowardly': Tekashi 6ix9ine opens up about violent gym attack</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'You belong in hell!' Sam Smith viciously heckled in NYC after racy performance of 'Unholy' at Grammys 2023</a></p><h2 class=split>'I'm still kind of shaken up over it'</h2><p>The DJ further revealed that when he discussed the incident with a group of individuals at a gym, they suggested that <a href=# rel>mental illness</a> must have played a role, but that, in his opinion, did not justify the behavior. Duran stated, "I understand the component of mental illness, but at same time, just because you're mentally ill doesn't give you the right to be a total a*****e and start slashing people."</p><p>Duran stated that the experience reminded him "how fragile life is." He said, "I'm still kind of shaken up over it. A little bit. It would have happened had I not put my arm up." However, he insisted he would still keep exploring Manhattan and still had a lot of affection for New York. "I love my city," he stated.</p><h2 class=split>'We need Elvis protected at all costs'</h2><p>Many reacted to Duran's attack in NYC on Twitter with a person writing, "So glad he's ok!"

I love you guys."</p><p>A third person wrote, "A mantra I've heard, agree with, and personally live by is 'mental illness is not your fault but it is your responsibility'. Very scary but so glad he's okay. This world would be darker without @elvisduran in it!" Another person wrote, "So glad she didn't get to do anything to him or anyone else.
