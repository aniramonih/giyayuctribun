The lifespan of some of the figures in the Bible is among its greatest mysteries. In the Bible, the oldest man lived for nearly a million years.</p><p>In the Bible, there are many examples of long-lived individuals. These people lived to be very old, even by today’s standards. The oldest person in the Bible was Methuselah, who lived to be 969 years old.</p><p>The patrilineal line that runs from Adam to Noah is made up entirely of characters from the Book of Genesis. As they were living prior to the Flood, these ten individuals are referred to as the Antediluvian patriarchs.</p><p>They all had extraordinarily long lives, with the majority passing away at or after the age of 900. Many of the oldest males in their ancestry were still living when the subsequent men in their line were born because of their extended lifespans.<br>The ages of these men are difficult to accept, but many people do not take these tales literally, so you are free to choose how you wish to read the Bible.</p><p>Many people have made an effort to explain why they think these men actually did live to be almost 1,000 years old.</p><p><strong>The table below contains the name and ages of the top 10 Oldest People in the Bible</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Oldest People in the Bible&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Age&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>1</span></td><td>Methuselah</td><td>969 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>2</span></td><td>Jared</td><td>&nbsp;962 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>3</span></td><td>Noah</td><td>950 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>4</span></td><td>Adam</td><td>930 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>5</span></td><td>Seth</td><td>&nbsp;912 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>6</span></td><td>Kenan</td><td>910 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>7</span></td><td>Enos</td><td>905 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>8</span></td><td>Mahalalel</td><td>895 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>9</span></td><td>Lamech</td><td>777 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>10</span></td><td>Enoch</td><td>365 years</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>1. Methuselah – 969 years</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Methuselah.jpg alt=Methuselah width=1500 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>Father: Enoch</strong></p><p><strong>Grandson: Noah</strong></p><p><strong>Son: Lamech</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage: Genesis 5:21-27&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Methuselah is one of the oldest people mentioned in the Bible. He lived to be 969 years old, making him the oldest man in history.</p><p>Methuselah, who passed away at the age of 969, is the oldest person mentioned in the Bible. He is identified as Lamech’s father, Noah’s grandpa, and Enoch’s son in the Book of Genesis. Given that he is a part of the lineage that connects Adam to Noah, his story in the Bible is noteworthy.</p><p>Most Bible translations state that Methuselah was close to 200 years old when Lamech, his son, was born and when he passed sometime shortly after the Flood from Noah’s tale. Because of his advanced age, Methuselah has gained popularity and his name is frequently used to indicate the older age of individuals or things.</p><h2>2. Jared – 962 years</h2><p><strong>Father: Mahalaleel</strong></p><p><strong>Son: Enoch</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage: Genesis 5:18-21&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As a sixth-generation descendant of Adam and Eve, Jared is the second-oldest man in the Bible. Jered is&nbsp;Mahalaleel’s first child, he was born when his father was 65 years old. In 3544 BCE, he was born.</p><p>He had a son named Enoch when he was 162 years old. He welcomed additional sons and daughters during his further eight hundred years of life. He passed away in 2582 BC at the age of 962.</p><h2>3. Noah – 950 years</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Noah.jpg alt=Noah width=1500 height=900 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Father: Lamech</strong></p><p><strong>Grandfather: Methuselah</strong></p><p><strong>Sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth</strong></p><p>Since the Genesis flood tale in the Bible tells the story of Noah, he is one of the most well-known Biblical characters. The fundamentals of the story of Noah’s Ark, which claims that God flooded the Earth to wipe away mankind’s transgressions and recreated the earth with the animals and Noah and his family onboard the Ark, are undoubtedly known to the majority of people.</p><p>One of the many flood myths that have appeared throughout human culture and history is the tale of Noah’s Ark. One of the individuals in the Bible who lived to be over 900 years old is Noah, who is another direct descendant of Adam and Eve.</p><p>He is the grandson of Methuselah and the son of Lamech. When he was 500 years old, Noah gave birth to Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p><h2>4. Adam – 930 years</h2><p><strong>Wife: Eve</strong></p><p><strong>Sons: Cain, Abel, and Seth</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis 1; Genesis 2:4- 3:24; Genesis 4; and Genesis 5&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Book of Genesis uses Adam’s name as the word for man or mankind, making him best recognized as the first man ever created by God.<br>Many people are familiar with the tale of Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden. The first murderous episode is described in Genesis 4 after Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden for eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>They have two kids named Cain and Abel. Seth, their third child, begins the line of Adam and Eve’s ancestors that eventually leads to Noah. Adam passed away when he lived to the age of 930.</p><h2>5. Seth – 912 years</h2><p><strong>Parents: Adam and Eve</strong></p><p><strong>Wife: Azura</strong></p><p><strong>Son: Enos</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis 4; Genesis 5; 1 Chronicles 1:1-3&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Seth, the third child of Adam and Eve, was conceived after his brother Abel was killed. In the patrilineal line of Adam and Eve’s offspring that preceded Noah’s birth, he is the first son. Only three of Adam and Eve’s children are identified by name in the Bible: Seth, Cain, and Abel.</p><p>Seth was born when Adam was 130 years old, and according to his Genesis account, Eve thought that Seth was meant to take the place of Abel. As the upright son of Adam and Eve, Seth is respected in Jewish and Islamic cultures. He was the fifth-oldest man in the Bible and passed away at the age of 912.</p><h2>6. Kenan – 910 years</h2><p><strong>Father: Enos</strong></p><p><strong>Grandfather: Seth Son: Maleleel</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis 5:9,10,12,13,14; Luke 3:36-37; and 1 Chronicle 1:2&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kenan, who is the grandson of Seth and the son of Enos, is another member of Adam’s lineage. The Book of Jubilees, also known as the Lesser Genesis, claims that Noam, Enosh’s wife, and sister, was the mother of Kenan.</p><p>Mualeleth, who was also his sister, was his wife. Kenan, who was on this list, was nearly 900 years old when he passed away and lived before the Great Flood.</p><h2>7. Enos – 905 years</h2><p><strong>Grandparents: Adam and Eve</strong></p><p><strong>Father: Seth Son: Kenan</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis 4:26; Genesis 5:6-11; and Luke 3:38&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adam’s grandson Enos, also known as Enosh, is Seth’s first child and is not to be confused with Enoch. Genesis records that Seth was 105 years old when Enos was born. Enos was 90 years old, according to the Bible, when his first son Kenan was born.</p><p>He outlived Adam, Seth, and Enoch and was one of Noah’s contemporaries for 84 years. He lived to reach 905 years old.</p><h2>8. Mahalalel – 895 years</h2><p><strong>Father: Kenan</strong></p><p><strong>Wife: Dinah</strong></p><p><strong>Son: Jared</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis 5:12-17; 1 Chronicle 1:1; Jubilees 4:14-15; and Luke 3:37&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Seth’s great-grandson was Mahalalel. In the Bible, his name appears eight times. He goes by the name of Maleleel in some translations of the Holy Book. At the time of his birth, Kenan, his father, was 70 years old. Jared’s father, Mahalalel, passed away at the age of 895.</p><h2>9. Lamech – 777 years</h2><p><strong>Son: Noah</strong></p><p><strong>Father: Methuselah</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis Chapter 5; Luke 3:36&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lamech is well-known for being the father of Noah, who passed away at the age of 777, just before the Great Flood. In Genesis 5:29, he names his first son Noah and says, “This one will comfort us concerning our labor and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed.” He is the only patriarch before the Flood who is quoted, aside from Adam.</p><p>According to the timeline in the Bible, Adam was still alive for the first 56 years of Lamech’s life, who was 182 when Noah was born.</p><h2>10. Enoch – 365 years</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Enoch.jpg alt=Enoch width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Son: Methuselah</strong></p><p><strong>Father: Jared</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passages: Genesis 5:18-24; Luke 3:37; Hebrews 11:5; and Jude 1:14-15&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Enoch was a devoted servant of God. He was Noah’s great-grandfather and the great-great-great-grandson of Adam. He had a son named Methuselah, which was a blessing. Christians recall Enoch as one of only two individuals who God brought directly to heaven, i.e., he did not die as other people do. The second individual who survived was Elijah. Instead, he was transported to heaven in a fiery chariot. When he was 365 years old, Good snatched him.</p><h2>Top 10 Oldest People in the Bible and Their Age</h2><p>The table below contains the name and ages of the top 10 Oldest People in the Bible</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Oldest People in the Bible&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Age&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>1</span></td><td>Methuselah</td><td>969 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>2</span></td><td>Jared</td><td>&nbsp;962 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>3</span></td><td>Noah</td><td>950 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>4</span></td><td>Adam</td><td>930 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>5</span></td><td>Seth</td><td>&nbsp;912 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>6</span></td><td>Kenan</td><td>910 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>7</span></td><td>Enos</td><td>905 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>8</span></td><td>Mahalalel</td><td>895 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>9</span></td><td>Lamech</td><td>777 years</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>10</span></td><td>Enoch</td><td>365 years</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, the Bible records the names of many people who lived to be quite old. The oldest person in the Bible was Methuselah, who lived to be 969 years old.</p><p>Other long-lived individuals include Jared, Noah, Adam, and so on. While the life spans of these individuals are impressive, it is important to remember that they lived in a different time when people had different lifestyles.</p><p>The Top 10 Oldest People in the Bible and Their Age are, nonetheless, a topic we hope you will find interesting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOqKOdnaOperGxzqmjnmWZo3q1tMRmmaKanJp6orrDZquhnZmneqKzxGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alleged-toddler-basher-tried-to-silence-girlfriend-after-child-left-with-horrendous-injuries.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Traralgon man Benjamin Stockdale accused of leaving toddler with horrendous injuries">&larr;
