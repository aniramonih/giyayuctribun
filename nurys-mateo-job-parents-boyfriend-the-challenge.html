Besides reality show what is her job? Is she on OnlyFans? Who are her parents and what is her ethnicity? Does she have a boyfriend?</p><p>Scroll down to read all about Nurys.</p><h3><strong>The Challenge: Nurys Mateo Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>Nurys Mateo of The Challenge confirmed her romantic connection with fellow cast member Horacio Gutierrez in 2023. The now-dating couple appeared as rookie castmates on the 38th season of MTV’s popular competitive series, Ride or Die, although they did not engage in a romantic relationship in any of the episodes.</p><p>Nurys and Horacio’s dating rumor began when she shared several videos where she gushed over a guy, prompting speculation about who she was referring to. She referred to herself as the “luckiest girl” in one video and described how the unknown man had surprised her with a skydiving date. In another video, she flaunted an Apple Store bag containing a pair of Airpod Max headphones, hinting that a guy had bought her a pair after she stated that she needed new ones.</p><p>After traveling to New York on September 24, the pair showed Horacio her father, elder brother, grandfather, and closest friend. The couple is figuring out their distance relationship. She revealed after five days apart, “We’re just not used to going this long without seeing each other so it’s definitely hard right now.”</p><p>Then, it appears like Nurys and Horacio are officially dating outside of the show because they have shared similar posts on social media.</p><p>Superfan account @thechallenge_news released an Instagram Story clip of Nurys kissing an unidentified male off-screen on Saturday night. Although the man’s face is only seen from the side, he is sporting sunglasses and has bangs that hang over his forehead. It’s not clear enough to identify who it is, but it might be Horacio.</p><p>Horacio is pictured with his Ride or Dies cast mates at the reunion on the third slide down. Among them are Jay Starrett, Olivia Kaiser, and Nurys, who leans her head against Horacio’s shoulder.</p><p>Nurys left room for interpretation and speculation when she first published the Instagram Story with the mysterious man. Horacio reposted the Instagram Story video of Nurys’ kiss on his account. He also included a graphic of two hands creating a heart and the words “Life lately” in cursive writing in the corner.</p><p>More about their relationship, Nurys has also gushed on her IG that Horacio never stops flirting with her. She added as a caption on a <a href=#>cozy pic</a> of the two, “Dating someone who naturally brings out your childlike playfulness, makes you laugh, never stops flirting with you, and loves you a little extra on the days you don’t feel loveable >>> ♥️”</p><p>In <a href=#>another post</a>, Nurys revealed that she never knew love until she met her main man Horacio.</p><p>Horacio is 27 as of this writing in October 2023. He is a midfielder and has played for several teams over the years. In April 2023, it was reported that Horacio was playing for San Diego Sockers. He hailed from El Paso, Texas.</p><p>Before she went public with her relationship, she had trolled fans about dating Jordan but her fans were not excited about their prospective relationship because they believed Tori might have feelings for Jordan. Nurys herself revealed that she didn’t want to hurt Tori by spending time with Jordan.</p><p>Jordan claimed that he found Nurys attractive right away after entering the house, but they didn’t make a move because she was dating rookie Johnny Middlebrooks at the time. Despite their showmance, Jordan claimed he saw Nurys’s interest in him as well, and the two hit it off a few weeks after Johnny’s early exit. Jordan denied that he pursued Nurys out of vengeance.</p><p>The Real World star emphasized that the affair was not “planned” and that he did not expect anything to happen with her. Despite the fact that his cuddling with Nurys caused a schism between Tori and Jordan this season, the previous winner says he doesn’t regret his engagement with the newcomer. Jordan says it forced him and Tori to have conversations they had avoided since their breakup, which led to closure.</p><p>Now, Tori and Jordan are no longer together.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Nurys Mateo?</strong></h3><p>Born in 1995, Nurys Mateo reached age 28 in February 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Nurys Mateo Parents?</strong></h3><p>The only parent of Nurys Mate we currently know about is her dad Jesus Mateo.

She gushed, “My mom told me she likes this picture because I look innocent when we all know I’m not 😇.”</p><p>Moreover, Nurys has two brothers and one of them is named Emmet aka <a href=#>Big E</a>. Big E turned 25 years old in August 2023.</p><p>Their older brother turned 35 in August 2023.</p><p>Most recently in September 2023, Nurys revealed that Horacio got to meet her older brother, her dad, and her grandfather.</p><h3><strong>Nurys Mateo Job</strong></h3><p>Nurys Mateo is primarily a social media influencer and a fashion model.
