Her parents continued to travel other countries to fulfill their academic pursuits and she got to get her schooling in part at an all-girls’ school in Great Britain.</p><p>For college education, Huma enrolled at <strong>George Washington University</strong> in Washington D.C to study for a Bachelor’s Degree in Journalism with a minor in Political Science.</p><p>Upon a friend’s recommendation, Huma applied for a White House internship to work for President Clinton’s press secretary, Mike McCurry but ended up working for the First Lady, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Hillary Clinton</a>.</p><h3><strong>Occupation</strong></h3><ul><li>Hillary Clinton’s aide and personal advisor</li><li>Paid consultant to Clinton Foundation</li></ul><h3><strong>Family</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Father</strong> – Syed Zainul Abedin (1928–1993) (Professor, Scholar of Islamic & Middle Eastern Studies)</li><li><strong>Mother</strong> – Saleha Mahmood Abedin (Sociology Professor / Dean at Dar Al-Hekma University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs)</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong> – Hassan Abedin (Brother) (Scholar in Islamic Studies), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Heba Abedin</a> (Younger Sister) (PR, Fashion,&nbsp;and Social Media Consultant).

She was assisting Hillary Clinton during her first summer as a New York senator and was too focused on her work to notice or reciprocate Anthony’s interest and hence, declined to join his group for drinks at that retreat. Over the years, the two kept running into each other and Huma eventually got attracted to Anthony for his eloquent public speaking and passionate involvement in politics. In 2008, the couple started dating. They were engaged in 2009 and got married in 2010 in Long Island, New York. Their wedding ceremony was conducted by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bill Clinton</a> himself while Hillary Clinton threw the couple an engagement party at her Washington home where she proclaimed Huma as her “second daughter.” Huma gave birth to a son named Jordan Zain Weiner in December 2011. From 2011 to 2016, Anthony Weiner was frequently featured in the tabloids for sending sexually explicit messages to multiple women including a minor. Even though he resigned from Congress in 2011, he continued to attract grave criticism and negative publicity. In September 2017, he was sentenced to 2 years in prison for exchanging obscene messages with a minor. For many years, Huma continued to hold on to her marriage for the sake of her son but finally released a statement declaring her separation in August 2016. She filed for divorce in May 2017 but withdrew her case in January 2018 with the intention to settle it privately hoping to protect her son from further embarrassment. In November 2021, it was revealed that their divorce was in its final stages.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Bradley Cooper</a>&nbsp;</strong>(2022) – In July 2022, it was reported that Huma was dating actor Bradley Cooper.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/United-States.png><h3><strong>Race / Ethnicity</strong></h3><p>Asian</p><p>Both her parents were born and brought up in Colonial India.

However, the intensity of her professional life does not always allow consistent commitment to exercise.</p><p>She claims to be fond of food and contrary to what her slim almost gaunt appearance might convey, she looks forward to all her meals every day.</p><p>Huma is not particular about <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eating clean</a> either.
