The couple has been together for several years, leading a beautiful family with their kids.</strong></p><p>Laura Wibbenmeyer is a well-known television personality mainly recognized for her stint with a CBS-affiliated station KFVS-TV, as the first alert meteorologist.</p><p>She has been serving in the position since 2005. Having earned her bachelor’s degree in Atmospheric Science, she began her career as a meteorologist immediately after graduating</p><p>Before joining KFVS-TV, Laura worked with KOMU-TV, KLFY-TV, and KTBS-TV. Wibbenmeyer is leaving KFVS12. She recently announced her departure via a social media post. Since then, there has been much curiosity about her personal and professional life.</p><p>In today’s short article, find out all the known details about the television personality’s husband and marital life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-laura-wibbenmeyer-husband></span>Who Is Laura Wibbenmeyer Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Laura Wibbenmeyer shares a blissful marital life with her husband of 10 years, Chase Wibbenmeyer.</p><p>The talented meteorologist often shares pictures with his beau on her social media. In addition, she also updates her fans and followers about her personal life occasionally. Despite all this, the weather forecaster kept her spouse’s profession and other details about her beau private.</p><p>The smitten pair dated for three years before tying the knot. While celebrating her 8th marriage anniversary, Laura joked she was still training her spouse to put his laundry in the basket, not next to it. She added, “but if that’s his biggest flaw, I am lucky. Lol, Love you, babe!”</p><p>The Wibbenmeyer pair’s marriage is still going strong. Let’s hope the lovely duo’s an ever-lasting bond with love, affection, and support.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laura-wibbenmeyer-kids-and-family></span>Laura Wibbenmeyer Kids And Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With a decade of marriage under their name, Luara and her husband, Chase Wibbenmeyer, are blessed with two baby girls, including Vivian Josephine Wibbenmeyer</p><p>The married duo welcomed their first bundle of joy – Vivian Josephine Wibbenmeyer – on 5 October 2014. Vivian was 6 pounds 12 ounces and 20 inches long at birth.</p><p>Laura and her hubby must have been over the moon to become parents first the first time. The First Alert Meteorologist’s first thought after giving birth was, “thank God she is here.” She added, “I was first just relieved that it was over and that the baby was out before it naturally transformed into pure joy when I could see her.”</p><p>The Wibbenmeyer couple also has another baby girl, whose name and birth details are unknown. But the youngest Wibbenmeyer appears to be 2 or 3 years younger than Vivian. The meteorologist’s daughters are growing from the public eye.</p><p>Laura loves to do anything that gets her adrenaline pumping, whether skydiving or white water rafting. The television personality enjoys playing volleyball, dancing, traveling, and spending time with her husband and two daughters.</p><p>The Wibbenmeyer family doesn’t miss any chance to spend time together and create precious memories. We wish the picture-perfect family a more wonderful and joyful time ahead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laura-wibbenmeyer-meteorologist-arrested-for-drunk-driving></span>Laura Wibbenmeyer Meteorologist Arrested For Drunk Driving<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Laura Wibbernmeyer was arrested for drunk driving in Scott Country in July 2011. It has been 12 years since the incident occurred, but the public doesn’t seem to have forgotten it.</p><p>Apart from the arrest news, there are no details about the 2011 arrest. Thus, Laura might not have faced much trouble. But the incident gained much media and public attention. People pointed out the disadvantage of being a public figure.</p><p><strong>You Might Like:&nbsp;</strong>Malaysia Flight 370 Bodies Found Reddit: Pilot Found Alive: Where Is Zaharie Ahmad Shah?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ylmK6qkWLEqq7BnqWmnamav2601KyZmqaUYriqsNJmmKecXZuurrXLsmSmnaSavLO7y6ieoqukYq6zvsSsq56cXZu8s3nDq6yno12Zv6rCyKeeaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./terry-amey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Nia Guzman's ex-husband Terry Amey?
