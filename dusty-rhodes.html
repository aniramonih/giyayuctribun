Virgil Riley Runnels Jr. is his given name. He was born in a low-income neighborhood of Austin, Texas, USA, the son of a plumber. He went to Johnston High School and graduated from there. Dusty went on to play baseball and football at West Texas State after graduating (now known as West Texas A&M University).</p><p>Following his professional career, this individual tried out for the American Football League’s Boston Patriots but was cut. Then he played in the Continental Football League for the Hartford Charter Oaks until the team folded. Dusty had a brother named Larry and a sister named Connie.</p><h2>Height And Weight</h2><p>Dusty stood 6 feet 2 inches or 188 cm tall and weighed 125 kilograms or 275 pounds. His eyes were blue, and his hair was white. Aside from that, this wrestler has not revealed any information about his body stats. As a result, his measurements, such as chest-waist-hip, dress size, and shoe size, are unknown.</p><h2>Dusty Rhodes Death</h2><p>Dusty suffered from kidney disease in his later years. On June 10, 2015, paramedics were called to Rhodes’ home in Orlando, Florida, after receiving a call that he had fallen. Soon after, they drove him to a nearby hospital, where he died the next day, June 11, 2015, from the effects of kidney failure.</p><p>After his death, he was cremated, and his ashes were spread in November 2015 by his son Dustin on a ranch that Rhodes enjoyed visiting. Furthermore, at the 2015 Money in the Bank pay-per-view event, Dusty Rhodes was honored with a ten-bell salute, with the entire WWE roster and the McMahon family on the entrance ramp.</p><p>Similarly, they honored him the following night on Raw with a video tribute and a special after Raw on the WWE Network. Dusty was also honored with another ten-bell salute at the NXT tapings following his death.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Dusty has been one of the most well-known and entertaining professional wrestlers in history. He began wrestling in the 1960s and quickly established himself as a fast-talking, hard-rocking wrestler. He is best known for his work with the National Wrestling Alliance, Jim Crockett Promotions, and the World Wrestling Federation, later renamed the WWE.</p><p>This well-known figure was a three-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, and during his time with Jim Crockett Promotions, later known as WCW, he was a United States Heavyweight Champion, World Tag Team, and multi-time World Television and World Six-Man Tag Team Champion.</p><p>He also won numerous regional titles and is one of seven men inducted into the WWE, WCW, Professional Wrestling, and Wrestling Observer Newsletter Halls of Fame. Dusty teamed up with fellow Texan the late Dick Murdoch early in his career, and they wreaked havoc in on-again, off-again tag team appearances for over 20 years.</p><p>Dusty finally won his first NWA World heavyweight championship in 1979 by defeating the “Handsome” Harley Race. Despite the fact that his first title reign lasted less than a week, he went on to win the NWA title twice more. His son Dustin also appeared as “Golddust” on Spike TV’s WWE Raw (1993) series.</p><p>Dusty made sporadic on-air appearances on WWE television and pay-per-views after retiring from wrestling, and he worked as a backstage booker and producer in WWE’s NXT developmental territory.</p><p>Furthermore, despite being billed as “the son of a plumber,” Dusty did not have a typical wrestler’s physique; rather, his character was that of the “common man,” popular for the personality displayed in his interviews.</p><h2>Dusty Rhodes Wife, Marriage</h2><p>Dusty and Sandra were married from 1965 to 1975. Similarly, he married Michelle Rubio in 1978. And until he died in 2015, the couple had been married for 37 years. He also had four children: Dustin, Kristin, Teil, and Cody Runnels. He, too, had six grandchildren.</p><h2>Dusty Rhodes’s Net Worth</h2><p>At the time death, Dusty had a 3 million dollar net worth.
