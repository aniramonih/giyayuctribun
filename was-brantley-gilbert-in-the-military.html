However, he is an avid and stalwart supporter of the armed forces, doing all he can to help veterans and those serving in defense of the country.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about Brantley Gilbert’s interactions with the military.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Superstar Supporter</h2><p>Brantley Gilbert has, for a long time, made his support for the military known. Not only does he take every opportunity to help out veterans and serving members of the military, but he’s also written songs to show support.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Impacting Our Future, <a href=# rel=noopener>Gilbert explained that his views</a> on the military are deeply personal. His family has a long legacy and history related to the armed forces. The interview discusses how his maternal grandfather served in the military, along with several uncles.&nbsp;</p><p>Having this close proximity to soldiers and those serving in the armed forces had an influential impact on Gilbert. He came to recognize the struggles that some veterans would experience on their return home, or to civilian life.&nbsp;</p><p>While he makes his living on the stage as a superstar country singer, Gilbert remains grounded when it comes to the military. He’s a staunch advocate of supporting veterans, and has suggested that people go out and speak to them where possible. He did just this with a veteran named Justin Patterson.&nbsp;</p><p>Patterson was an outspoken sufferer of PTSD, having been impacted massively by IEDs while in combat. After saying how Brantley changed his life with his support and care, Patterson gave him one of his coveted <a href=# rel=noopener>Purple Heart medals</a>. You can see this heartwarming event on YouTube.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>On His Skin</h2><p>Brantley Gilbert isn’t just a supporter of the military, but also everything it stands for. He’s an outspoken advocate for national tribute such as Memorial Day. In an article in 2018, Gilbert went on file saying, “I have these guys and girls to thank for my freedom and the things that I was able to do today because of my freedom.”&nbsp;</p><p>He’s very direct when it comes to his support for other aspects of armament, also. In 2015, Gilbert had his entire back adorned with <a href=# rel=noopener>an extravagant tattoo</a> created in tribute to the Second Amendment. This amendment essentially permits American citizens the right to bear arms. This tattoo is the ultimate commitment to what he believes in.</p><p>While not performing or supporting the soldiers, Gilbert has taken many opportunities to show his love for animals. He and his wife support an organization that awards service dogs to veteran soldiers that need them. His wife is also a supporter of the armed forces, and works hand in hand to help Gilbert in his endeavours.</p><p>During a 2018 tour, Gilbert took a moment to honor veterans, and awarded eight dogs to injured and disabled veterans. <a href=# rel=noopener>In an interview</a>, he said, “Nothing helps heal like an animal’s love.”&nbsp;</p><p>Having been in the business since 2005, Brantley makes for a very prolific supporter. The work that he undertakes is propelled by his influence and impression in the public spotlight. As of 2020, Gilbert has released five studio albums and a further sixteen singles. He’s won numerous awards and accolades, and has celebrated several number one hits.</p><p>While Brantley Gilbert didn’t serve in the military, there are some country singers who have. The most famous of which might be Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. These world-famous performers served in the armed forces, and all retired to a career in the arts.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCYrGWSp66vwMuesGafmaGvpr7TZqCnZaSdsm65yKWgrZmirnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-fans-might-not-know-about-levar-burton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Fans Might Not Know About LeVar Burton">&larr;
