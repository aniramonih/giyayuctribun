Who is GassyMexican’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>GassyMexican is known for a few things.</p><p>He is a Machinima director.</p><p>He is a Let’s Play YouTube commentator.</p><p>He is one-half of the former influencer couple known as GassyMexican and <a href=# rel=noopener>CurvyLlama</a>.</p><p>He is a former The Creatures commentator.</p><p>He is a big fan of impersonating celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Mickey Mouse.</p><p>He is all these things and then some, so let’s have a look at everything we know about the GassyMexican who has a following in the millions.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>For starters, the GassyMexican’s real name is Max Lorenzo Gonzalez, and he was born on December 25, 1990.</p><p>That’s right, he was born on Christmas Day.</p><p>He’s got a brother named Jaime, who is married to Kaye.</p><p>Max was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised on the outskirts of the bustling metropolis.</p><p>He attended Grant Community High School in Fox Lake, a village most well-known for being a water sporting hot spot.</p><p>Dubbed the Heart of the Chain O’ Lakes for its close proximity to Grass Lake, Marie Lake, and Nipperskink—plus its location along the Fox River to link the other seven minor lakes—Max was well-positioned to become an outdoorsman.</p><p>But he didn’t—he knew he loved gaming from a very young age.</p><p>He’s also a fan of hockey—especially the Chicago BlackHawks—basketball and football.</p><p>He loved it so much, in fact, that he bailed on his hometown early and headed for Denver, Colorado, to join up with some other gaming buddies he’d met online.</p><p>Those guys would eventually invite him to join their gaming collaboration crew—the Creatures.</p><h2><strong>Love Is In The Cyber-Air</strong></h2><p>Once Gonzalez had graduated from Grant Community high school, he made his move.</p><p>Not long after joining the Creatures at their Colorado content creators’ mansion, he met Renee Reynosa—a California girl who also did live streaming.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41935 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GassyMexican-and-girlfriend-Renee-LolRenaynay-Reynosa.jpg.webp alt="GassyMexican and girlfriend Renee LolRenaynay Reynosa" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -
