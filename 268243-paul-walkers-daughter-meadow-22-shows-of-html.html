The couple were a lovely duo as they enjoyed each other's company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5fa5ff322dcc2fdf838d3bcf26ea4a3b.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Paul Walker at Empire Leicester Square on May 7, 2013. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEADOW SHOWS OFF HER MAN</strong></p><p class=dh>The youngster and her boyfriend cuddled up on a comfy striped chair staring into each other's eyes. She rocked a white vest and black track pants that matched the dark hue of her short wavy hair.</p><p class=dh>Meadow smiled at her boyfriend, who donned a whimsical T-shirt over a pair of khaki pants. He also rocked a purple and white baseball cap. Thornton-Alan also smiled into his girlfriend's eyes. He sweetly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CRHg65iJwYl/>captioned</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Best friend."</p><p class=dh>Fans gushed at the duo showing their affection. Meadow was also in the comment section where she declared that Thorton-Alan was the love of her life. She also caught the attention of her dad's former co-star, Jordan Brewster.</p><p class=dh>Meadow also took to her Instagram story, where she posted a romantic print of her and her boyfriend in a blue-hued setting. The duo had their faces close to each other with sweet smiles.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>INSIDE MEADOW'S RELATIONSHIP WITH VIN DIESEL</strong></p><p class=dh>Following the tragic passing of Hollywood star Paul Walker in 2013, fans witnessed how his fellow star Vin Diesel helped his daughter deal with the loss.</p><p class=dh>Now Meadow adores Vin, and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/paul-walker-daughter-meadow-dating-louis-thornton-allan-instagram-official-romance-photos/>according to</a> him, she is usually the first person to send a Father's Day message.

He noted that he looked up to the deceased when it came to parenting.</p><p class=dh>Vin made it known that although he was the big brother on set, Paul was his backbone in real-life parenting. The star actor made it known that Paul was his rock.</p><p class=dh>The "Fast and Furious" actor noted that Paul stood by him so much that even in the delivery room for his last child, Pauline, he felt the late actor's presence. Vin added that his mom has also attested to it.</p><p class=dh>The same love Vin has for Paul has transcended on the late star's young adult daughter. During Meadow's birthday in 2019, the 53-year-old actor relayed that he had always been proud of her.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE FAMILY</strong></p><p class=dh>Vin's "Fast and Furious" character Dominic "Dom" Torreto is quite particular about family, and it is safe to say that Vin has adopted some of Dom's values in his real-life activities.</p><p class=dh>Vin has also been teaching his young ones this essence. In a recent interview with ET's Nischelle Turner about "F9," Turner pointed out that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/vin-diesel-on-bringing-his-son-and-paul-walkers-daughter-into-the-fast-family-exclusive-167311>Meadow recognizes</a> the value of family and showed it on social media.</p><p class=dh>In the post, Meadow presented the image of her and Vin, which she captioned, "Family." Vin noted that he was quite impressed by this because it indicated the "success of the soul."</p><p class=dh>She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9635169/Paul-Walkers-daughter-Meadow-calls-Vin-Diesel-daughter-Hania-family-sweet-photo.html>also expressed</a> family love in another of her posts where she presented a heartwarming image of the moment Vin held her and his teenage daughter, Haina, in a hearty hug.</p><p class=dh>In the same vein, <a class="me a" href=#>Meadow </a>has kept her dad's memories alive through the years. The actor died at the age of 40 in a crash. Paul's Porsche Carrera GT had crashed into a metal pole, and he did not survive the impact.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttcWpkaHqxrdSlZLCZnKCys7%2BMnZiun5ipsrN5zJ6YnaenYn9zedKhprCrXaSzb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./petula-clark-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Petula Clark Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
