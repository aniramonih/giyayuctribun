The exact date of his birth is unknown.&nbsp;Merri’s love for the sport was sparked at a very young age and for most of her life she dragged it onto the court in hopes of one day enjoying a fully professional career.&nbsp;She is focused and mentally resilient.&nbsp;attributes that all of her coaches have admired in her for someone her age.</span></p><p><span>Although nothing is known about Merri Hannity’s years of growth or education, it is known that she was a crucial high school tennis player.&nbsp;In 2016, she also memorably represented the Cold Spring Harbor in Nassau while in 9th grade.&nbsp;Merri Kelly Hannity made it to the Nassau County singles title match where she defeated Oyster Bay representative Courtney Kowalsky 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 to win the title.</span></p><h2><b><span>Family: parents and siblings</span></b></h2><p><span>Through the union of her parents, Sean Hannity, and Jill Rhodes, Merri has one sibling, one brother, Sean Patrick Hannity.&nbsp;Sean is four years older than her.&nbsp;He was born on November 3, 1998. Like Merri, her brother also has a professional tennis career and started training even before she took the lead.</span></p><p><span>Merri’s father Sean had no sports experience growing up as he always had his sights set on a career in journalism.&nbsp;He began his career as a volunteer talk show host at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1989. Sean would later hold positions at WVNN, WABC and WGST.&nbsp;He joined Fox in 1996 and co-hosted the live television show&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hannity & Colmes</span></i><span>&nbsp;with</span><span>&nbsp;Alan Colmes&nbsp;</span><span>until 2008.&nbsp;</span><span>The TV star is best known for his nationally syndicated radio talk show,&nbsp;</span><i><span>Sean Hannity’s show,</span></i><span>&nbsp;and his cable news show&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hannity.</span></i></p><p><span>Merri Kelly Hannity’s mother, Jill Rhodes, also works in the same industry as her father.&nbsp;In fact, they both met in the line of duty.&nbsp;</span><span>Jill earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Alabama.&nbsp;She also received training in theology and pastoral care at Liberty University.&nbsp;Prior to joining Sean and deciding to focus more on the home front, Jill Rhodes was a political columnist for the Huntsville Times.&nbsp;It was here that she met her future husband, who at the time was employed by WVNN in Huntsville.</span></p><h2><b><span>All About Sean Hannity’s Daughter</span></b></h2><h4><strong><span>1. Merri Kelly Hannity is not active on social media</span></strong></h4><p><span>As unusual as it may seem, the future tennis star has no social media presence – at least not under his real name.&nbsp;Whether this is a tactic to keep prying eyes of the media out of his life or if it’s a way to minimize distractions in his career is up for debate.</span></p><h4><strong><span>2. Merri’s father is a strong supporter of the Trump presidency</span></strong></h4><p><span>Her father, Sean has always been a conservative and has shown such since his days co-hosting&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hannity & Colmes.&nbsp;</span></i><span>So perhaps it’s no surprise that the show’s host is a strong supporter of President Trump.&nbsp;He defends many of his policies and even talks to him directly on weekdays, every week.</span></p><h4><strong><span>3. Her father, Sean Hannity, is a college dropout.</span></strong></h4><p><span>Reportedly, Merrivaleur’s family net is valued at $80 million, largely thanks to Hannity’s work.&nbsp;However, the political commentator did not always have the money to do what he wanted.&nbsp;In fact, lack of financial means was the reason her father from Merri could never stay in school long enough to graduate.&nbsp;He briefly worked for two years at the University of Santa Barbara, New York University and Adelphi University.</span></p><h4><strong><span>4. She has a book dedicated to her</span></strong></h4><p><span>Merri Kelly Hannity’s father is also an author.&nbsp;In 2002, he published his first book,&nbsp;</span><i><span>“Let Freedom Ring: Winning the Freedom War on Liberalism.”&nbsp;</span></i><span>He dedicated the book to Merri, her brother, and her mother, Jill.</span></p><h4><strong><span>5. His mom doesn’t support Sean’s position with the president.</span></strong></h4><p><span>Sean has been a longtime supporter of Trump and his views since before he won the election.&nbsp;And it’s been good for business because it’s helped make his shows some of the most watched and listened to across the country.</span></p><p><span>While his mother is also conservative at heart, she opposes her husband’s support for Trump, mainly because she believes the president is misogynistic.&nbsp;However, she does not talk about her reservations in public.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGillae%2FqnnKnqOlsV2drq%2B6yK2wZpqZpHq0tcGloKefo2KurbiMmpmoraRiwKatzWafmqaensG6v4ydmK6fmKmys3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-yeoh-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Yeoh Net Worth 2024">&larr;
