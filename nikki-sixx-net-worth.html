This was a remarkable deal as the band members had bought the rights to their masters from their record company in the 1990s for only $10 million.</p><h2><span id=Nikki_Sixxs_Early_Life>Nikki Sixx’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Nikki Sixx was born Frank Carlton Serafino Feranna, Jr. on December 11, 1958, in San Jose, California. His father left the family when Nikki was young. He was raised by his mother, Deana Richards until she abandoned him. Sixx was then raised by his grandparents.</p><p>After getting into trouble as a teenager, including being expelled from school for selling drugs, he went to live with his mother in Seattle. Nikki wasn’t with his mom long, but it was long enough to learn to play the guitar. He bought his first bass guitar with the money he made selling a guitar he had stolen.</p><p>At 17, Sixx moved to Los Angeles and began auditioning for bands while working at various jobs. He joined the band Sister after answering an ad in a local newspaper. The band recorded a demo, but he was fired not long after. In the late 1970s, he legally changed his name to Nikki Sixx.</p><h2><span id=Nikki_Sixxs_Career_Highlights>Nikki Sixx’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Nikki Sixx founded Mötley Crüe in 1981 with Tommy Lee and later added Mick Mars. The band released their debut album, “Too Fast for Love,” on their record label Leathür Records in 1981. They signed with Epic Records and released “Shout at the Devil” in 1983, which was a massive hit. Mötley Crüe released three more albums in the 80s and three albums with two singers in the 90s. They reunited in 2004 and embarked on a reunion tour with the four original members of the band in 2006. In 2008, Mötley Crüe released their final album, “Saints of Los Angeles.” Sixx launched the clothing line “Royal Underground” in 2006 with musician Kelly Gray. In 2010, Sixx and Kerri Kasem hosted nationally syndicated rock/alternative music radio programs “Sixx Sense” and “The Side Show Countdown.” In 2020, Mötley Crüe announced a summer stadium tour with Poison, Def Lepard, and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, which was postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h2><span id=Nikki_Sixxs_Personal_Life>Nikki Sixx’s Personal Life</span></h2><p>Nikki Sixx, former bassist of Mötley Crüe, struggled with heroin addiction during his time with the band. He reportedly overdosed multiple times, including once in 1987 when he was declared clinically dead for two minutes before being revived with adrenaline.</p><p>Sixx has been married three times and has four children. He was married to Playboy Playmate Brandi Brandt from 1989 until their divorce in 1996, just one month before he married another Playboy Playmate, Donna D’Errico. The couple had one daughter before separating and ultimately divorcing in 2007. Sixx married his current wife, Courtney Bingham, in 2014, and they have a daughter born in 2019.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Sixx practices Transcendental Meditation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he and his family were spotted in Wyoming during stay-at-home orders.</p><h2><span id=Nikki_Sixxs_Real_Estate_Ventures>Nikki Sixx’s Real Estate Ventures</span></h2><p>In 2014, Nikki Sixx and his wife purchased a 10,300-square-foot mansion in Westlake Village for $4.125 million. The luxurious home features a swimming pool, spa, loggias, and six bedrooms. In 2020, he listed the property for $5.699 million and sold it for $5.18 million in 2021.</p><p>In addition to his Westlake Village mansion, Sixx also owned a home in Calabasas. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom property was listed for sale for $2.399 million after he purchased it for $1.89 million in 2011. The home includes a pool, spa, and barbecue center with a fireplace and pizza oven.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC6yKSiomWjnsW5ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./p-j-tucker-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="P.
