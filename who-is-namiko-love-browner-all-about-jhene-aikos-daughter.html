From her birth, Namiko Love Browner became very famous, thanks to her parents’ popularity, and many are eager to know more about her life.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Namiko Love’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name: </strong>Namiko Love Browner</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> November 19, 2008</li><li><strong>Namiko Love Browner’s Age:</strong>15 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed ethnicity</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Scorpio</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Namiko Love’s Parents: </strong>Jhene Aiko and O’Ryan Omir Browner</li><li><strong>Siblings: </strong>Noah Hasani</li><li><strong>Namiko Love Browner’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 6 inches</li><li><strong>Namiko Love Browner’s Weight: </strong>62kg</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Jhene Aiko and O’Ryan’s daughter</li></ul><h2><strong>Namiko Love Browner is 15 Years Old</strong></h2><p>Namiko Love Browner was born on the 19th of November 2008 to her parents, Jhene Aiko and O’Ryan Browner, who are both popular professional singers.</p><p>Her mother, Jhene Aiko, was very young when she conceived of the now-15; in fact, she was just 20 years old when she delivered her. Unfortunately, she went down with postpartum depression following her daughter’s birth, but thankfully, Jhene was able to overcome it.</p><p>Namiko and her mother share a very close mother-and-daughter bond which can be seen in photos posted on her mother’s Instagram page like her 13th birthday, which was celebrated as it marked her becoming a teenager. In the same vein, Namiko is also close to her father and spends quality time with him.</p><p>Namiko Love Browner is not an only child as she has a half-brother who is 14 years younger than her. He is named Noah Hasani and he is the product of a relationship her mother got involved in after she had parted ways with her father. Noah Hasani was born in November 2022 to Jhene Aiko and her longtime boyfriend, Big Sean. Namiko seems to be drawn to her half-brother and enjoys being around him.</p><p>On the aspect of her education, there is no information on the school she has attended or is currently attending. One thing that is sure is the fact that she is getting the right education in a prestigious institution as she comes from a very comfortable home.</p><h3><strong>Namiko’s Mother is An American Singer and Songwriter</strong></h3><p>Jhene Aiko is a widely recognized American singer and songwriter who is popular for being part of the now-defunct popular musical group B2k.. Although she goes by the nickname “Jhene” which her fans mostly recognize her with, Namiko’s mother’s full name is Jhene Aiko Efuru Chilombo and she was born on the 16th of March 1988 to her father Dr. Karamo Chilombo, and her mother, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Christine Yamamoto</a>.</p><p>According to sources Namiko Love Browner’s mother began her career at the young age of 14 and was signed with the Ultimate Group with her ‘cousin’ Lil’ Fizz as her marketer and Chris Stokes as her manager. She was also signed with Epic Records but had to leave both labels in other for her to comfortably further her education.</p><p>Jhene has featured in several B2K albums such as The Remixes – Volume 1, Santa Hooked Me Up, and others. In the course of her career, she has also been featured in music videos such as “Uh Huh”, B2K’s debut video and “Take it Slow” which happens to be O’ Ryan’s debut video among others. She has also gone ahead to feature in the soundtracks of some movies like You Got Served, Barbershop, The Master of Disguise, and The Proud Family, among others.</p><p>She has released two studio albums and one collaboration album while collaborating with other artists such as Drake, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa, Beyonce, and J. Cole, on their tours.</p><h3><strong>Namiko Love’s Father O’Ryan is A Singer and Model</strong></h3><p>In case you didn’t know, Namiko Love Browner’s father whose full name is O’Ryan Omir Browner is also a singer. He is equally the younger brother of the famous American R&B singer, Omarion with whom he share a striking resemblance. O’Ryan was born on February 12, 1987, in California where he was also raised.</p><p>The singer released his self-titled debut album, “O’Ryan” in 2004 but gained more popularity in 2022 after his nude video was released on Twitter from OnlyFans. There is not much information on Namiko’s father as he has not dropped any new music since his first in 2004. However, from his Instagram post, it looks like he has taken to modeling and presently maintains a low profile.</p><h3><strong>Namiko Love Browner’s Parents Met As Teenagers</strong></h3><p>Jhene Aiko and O’Ryan started dating in 2005 and they dated for three years. They met each other while they were still teenagers; Jhene was 17 years old while O’Ryan was 18 years old. The public is left to guess why they broke up because to date, neither of them has disclosed the reason for their split.</p><p>Many had speculated that they had parted ways because they were still very young and could not handle the responsibilities of being parents at a young age. Since her parents went their separate ways, they (Jhene and O’Ryan) have both remained on speaking terms and are co-parenting their daughter the best way they can.</p><h2><strong>Namiko, Just Like Her Parents, Seems to Have Taken to Music</strong></h2><p>True to the maxim, “the apple does not fall far from the tree”, the daughter of Jhene Aiko seems to have followed in her footsteps as a singer, as she too has a good voice and has begun performing on stage. She was seen performing on stage at her fifth-grade talent show in November 2020 where she made her mother proud.</p><p>The elated Jhene Aiko took to her Instagram page to share the video and also disclose how alike she and her daughter are not just in looks but also in their talents as great singers.</p><p>Namiko Love Browner collaborated with her mother on the 2017 album trip song titled Sing To Me and has also appeared in music videos such as Jhene Aiko: Eternal Sunshine (2015) and Jhene Aiko: The Pressure (2014).</p><p>In 2013, both mother and daughter were involved in a car accident, Jhene reenacted the accident in a music video that she released in 2015 titled “Eternal Sunshine”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmamkaK2rLuMpaavnV2Xv7DDzZ6pZpmcoXqirs6uq2aimJq7pnnAoqKoq12Zrrazx62cq2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-rachel-kiki-everything-to-know-on-youtuber.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Rachel Kiki?
