She wasn't famous before the commercials so she likely had to work for a standard day rate which at the time wouldn't have been more than $5,000 or $10,000. On the flip side, as the star of a national commercial that aired many thousands of times, she earned a royalty every time the commercial aired. She likely earned several hundred thousand dollars, potentially as much as $1 million during her time with Pepsi alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLWiuMuinGadmaiyr67Eq55mppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-dan-caldwell-make-latest-dan-caldwell-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Dan Caldwell Make?
