The pair has been engaged since 2021.</p><p>As Todej Pogacar secures a win in the seventh stage to remain victorious in Toure De France 2022, people have been curious about him and his personal life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tadej-pogacar-and-his-girlfriend-urska-zigart-are-a-power-couple-of-slovenian-cycling></span>Tadej Pogacar And His Girlfriend Urska Zigart Are A Power Couple Of Slovenian Cycling<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tadej Pogacar and Urska Zigart met at a training camp while they were both members of the cycling team headquartered in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. It was the shared interest and passion that connected them with each other.</p><p>Soon after that, they were giving&nbsp;interviews&nbsp;about how both of them learned several things from each other. Zigart started cycling later compared to her partner. She shared she was the type of person who would be nervous and anxious.</p><p>On the other hand, her boyfriend, Pogacar, is the calm and composed type who always has the confidence and strength to win whenever he starts. Everyone trains, but mental strength is equally important, and she believes Tadej has the one.</p><p>Likewise, Tadej also shared how his fiance provides him with advice on food and nutrition. He also said that she helps him to gain confidence during media appearances.</p><p>Tadej is reserved, whereas Zigart is a bubbly and extroverted person. And, when it comes to cycling, both are completely opposite. But, despite the differences, both of them try to help each other with their weaknesses, making them a power couple and much loved by the fans.</p><p>The fans were ecstatic when the couple announced their engagement in 2021. They have been waiting for the wedding date now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tadej-pogacar-is-two-times-tour-de-france-winner></span>Tadej Pogacar Is Two Times Tour de France Winner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tadej Pogacar is a two-time Tour De France winner, and some expect it will soon be his third one. He made his debut in the Tour de France in 2020 and became the twelfth rider to win the Tour de France in his first attempt and the first since 1983.</p><p>In stage seven of 21, Pogacar led the group of competitors for the general classification as they pursued down the single leader, Lennard Kamna, near the top of the Planche des Belles Filles.</p><p>And, take outperformed his main rival Jonas Vingegaard in the first mountain stage of the Tour de France, increasing his overall lead, reports&nbsp;NBC Sports.&nbsp;Many of his fans have been cheering up for him and wishing that he would bring over a third consecutive victory in cycling’s most famous competition.</p><p>Pogacar’s family and girlfriend were waiting for him at the finish line, making him joyful. He had shared about it in the interview after the event was over.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-tadej-pogacar-and-urska-zigart-getting-married-soon></span>Are Tadej Pogacar And Urska Zigart Getting Married Soon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tadej Pogacar and Urskar Zigar have been married since September 2021. However, the couple has not shared their wedding date.</p><p>It seems both of them are busy in their career. Pogacar is in his early 20s, whereas Zigart is in her mid-20s. It may take some time to hear about their marriage, but the fans have been looking forward to it for quite some time now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyRmbKrec%2Bonpqbkad6orrDZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1krqqjoK5uxsigmKusXZi8rrzErZxmmaRiwamxjK2mrqpdmbJustGapZydXWd9c36O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./terri-clark.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Terri Clark">&larr;
