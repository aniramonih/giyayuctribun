Eileen's second son Tristan was born on 15th July 1988.</p><p class=align-left>The Tate brothers were professional kickboxers-turned entrepreneurs but gained more fame as online influencers.

She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">used to cook</a> and wash dishes at educational facilities' cafeterias and canteens for a living. Eileen stopped working when her sons started making money and paying her bills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b6d4d9660388c146.png><h3>Eileen Tate's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>Eileen's net worth is unknown, but she has financially successful children.

Talking to the Mail (via The Sun), Cox said;</p>As far as I'm concerned, their dad would have respected their business acumen, but he wasn't into misogyny or anything like that. He was a nice guy and a hell of a chess player.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8cf5d737e9ab4730.jpg><h2>Does Andrew Tate have a relationship with his mother?</h2><p class=align-left>Despite not supporting Andrew's views, Eileen has kept in touch with her controversial son. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun reveals </a>that she visited him at his luxurious villa in Romania before his arrest in December 2022.</p><p class=align-left>The Tate brothers often appreciate Eileen for raising them as a single mother, but Andrew has credited his father, Emory, for teaching him to be a winner. The Tates usually saw Emory once a year when he visited England. Andrew's brother Tristan said in a previous podcast (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via Sportskeeda</a>);</p>The fact that I was taken to karate lessons every Sunday as an 8, 9, 10-year-old and then I found kickboxing and became the European kickboxing champion. That's not my father's doing. I would say that was my mother's doing.<h2>What happened to Andrew Tate's mum?</h2><p class=align-left>Eileen is still living in Luton, England. It is unclear what she does after retiring from being a diner lady, but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Andrew revealed</a> that he always sends her money.</p><p class=align-left>Eileen Tate lives away from the spotlight and is rarely spotted in public.
