The former couple wed for 13 years before divorcing in 2001.</strong></p><p>Charlotte and her family took care of Craig even after their divorce. In 1998, it was discovered that Craig—nicknamed Ironhead by NFL supporters—had aggressive bone cancer. The legendary player in the NFL passed away at the age of 39 after a tough battle. In his final days, Craig suffered a stroke that essentially rendered him paraplegic.</p><p>He had played professionally for ten years, yet even at the end, he still possessed the same passion and love for the game. Cameron and Connor, his two children, have carried on his NFL heritage. His oldest son, Cameron Heyward, recently won Walter Payton Man of the Year at the NFL Awards.</p><p>The player who has made the biggest impact on and off the field receives this distinction. To end child malnutrition, support educators and children, encourage young readers and combat cancer, he built The Heyward House.</p><h2>Who is Charlotte Heyward? Craig Heyward Wife</h2><p>The ex-wife of Craig Heyward, Charlotte Heyward, first became acquainted with him as a freshman at Carlow University. Craig met Charlotte during one of their dates; she was seeing Craig’s brother at the time. Charlotte’s best friend was seeing him.</p><p>Charlotte remembers Craig expressing something hurtful to her during their first meeting, to which Charlotte retorted with a more caustic remark. Craig was captivated by Charlotte’s defiant nature.</p><p>After that encounter, the two grew good friends, and they began dating a year later when Charlotte enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh. The pair got hitched young. Charlotte was 20 and Craig was 21. In a podcast from 2021, Charlotte talked about her 1988 marriage to the couple.</p><p>Charlotte, in the interview, stated that Atlanta was their favorite place to live and shared many happy memories of the couple interacting with other NFL families. Charlotte described how Craig was still excited about the game in the conclusion, a year after his passing. She told how Craig yelled as he wheeled himself out to the sidelines.</p><p>Craig and Charlotte got divorced before his 2006 passing. In 2001, they had already broken up. Charlotte wed former NBA star Cory Blackwell after divorcing Craig. After their divorce, Charlotte adopted a daughter named Meagan while they were still together. Following her marriage to Steven Wesley, Charlotte shared a lot of pictures on her X (formerly Twitter) account.</p><p>Charlotte is currently employed as a realtor and podcast host. Sports industry professionals are frequent guests on Charlotte’s podcast, It’s 3rd And One. Lisa Welsh, the mother of MLB player Jared Walsh, was recently invited to participate on her show.</p><h2>Craig Raised Three Sons with Charlotte</h2><p>Three of the four children that the late NFL athlete Craig Heyward had were shared by him and Charlotte. One of his children, Craig Heyward Jr., was spotted with a woman named Michelle Gray. In the footsteps of his father, Craig Heyward Jr. played football at Passaic High School and later attended Middle Tennessee State University.</p><p>Craig Heyward Jr. is married to Liza Nicole Heyward and works for the Passaic Board of Education. Two of Charlotte and Craig’s three boys continued their father’s NFL legacy as athletes. The couple’s eldest kid, Cameron Heyward, attended Ohio State for four years as an NCAA football player.</p><p>After being selected by the Steelers in 2011, he has gone on to become a well-known player. He has been selected for three First Teams All-Pro selections and six Pro Bowls. Their middle child, Corey Heyward, played collegiate basketball at Georgia Tech. He spent four seasons as a guard for the Yellow Jackets before graduating in 2017 with a degree in business administration.</p><p>Corey did not play professional sports, in contrast to his older brother. He shares a few pictures with his pals and posts updates about his brothers on Facebook, where he is quite active. Craig’s cancer diagnosis came as Charlotte was expecting their third child, Connor. Connor was born on January 22, 1999, and played football at Michigan State University. He plays tight end/fullback and was selected by the Steelers in the sixth round of the 2022 NFL Draft.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>NFL Player</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Trending News</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Rudy Gobert | Siblings And Family</a></h3>A well-known basketball player, Rudy Gobert has had a substantial impact on the sports community with his incredible on-court exploits.The basketball player Rudy Gobert-Bourgarel is from France.
